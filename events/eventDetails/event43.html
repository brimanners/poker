<p>Andrew L was a first time host and did not disappoint as 9 other heathen players descended south through the “Balti-Roll” estate towards the new venue.</p>

<p>With what can only be described as “Ham-gate”, hungry players who had turned up promptly for the 6.30 feast, devoured the wonderfully prepared Chicken Schnitzels sans ham, whilst latecomers had their meals augmented perfectly by the meat product. Moral of the story - punctuality is overrated!</p>

<p>With Mark V a late scratching after getting his arrival time back into Melbourne mixed up, and Mark L’s on, off, on status eventually allowing him to join the proceedings, a full 10 seat complement got ready for the nights action.</p>

<p>Our glorious host Andrew was into the action on the first hand, calling each bet by Ben, and with Andrew holding nothing, and Ben a pair of queens, people were wondering how long Andrew would stay in the game, and whether they would be kicked out of his house. He did though take down the second hand after betting on the turn and everyone folding, so a stay of execution for early departures was administered.</p>

<p>With blinds at the initial 50/100, Mark (A-K) was squaring off against Michael (J-Q), after Mark’s pre-flop bet was raised by Michael to $600! With a Jack high flop, Michael held on, and took a good early dollop of sturdy chips, unlike the food offerings that Mark suggested were on the floppy side. It’s fair to say that no-one was exempt from Mark’s diatribe during the course of the night, but all recipients enjoying the verbal sparring.</p>

<p>Brian had been seeing a few flops, but not making any inroads, but took a good pot of Michael after a decent river bet gave Michael something to think about. After eventually folding, Brian tabled his cards with the cards publically announcing he'd got away with a stone cold bluff.</p>

<p>With blinds up to 75/150, and a board running out with 4 diamonds, saw Mark take a stab at stealing the pot with nothing. He was called by Carlos, who everyone assumed must have at least one diamond, but instead took down the pot with pocket 6’s, causing many hearty guffaw’s around the table.</p>

<p>With vociferous derisions including, “Wombat is a flacid c***”, and retorts like “I want to punch you”, thrown around in jovial manner, Simon won the battle on the table and showed Mark who was boss by getting him to fold via river bet.</p>

<p>Andrew was involved in lot of the action, and with previous hands showing that people had no idea what he was playing, he peeled off $500 bets on each street, as his K-K hit the King high flop, with Mark holding K-4, and thus raiding Mark’s stack as a result.</p>

<p>With Mark now the dealer, he managed to deal a card to Michael under the table’s rim. Once the card was eventually retrieved, it was exposed as an ace, which of course would mean a few choice words being propelled at the dealer.</p>

<p>Michael soon had the last laugh though, as he wiped out both Mark and Simon with 2 pair, with both Simon and Mark making a pair of aces. With some charity chips allocated, play resumed, and Brian made a stab at the pot with a good river bet against Mark. “Walking F*(*ing nightmare” was the latest moniker attached, as he folded, but Brian's beguiling smile suggested he did have something this time, or maybe it was yet another bluff?</p>

<p>Simon made a massive $12k bet on a hand after making 2 pair, with Andrew calling on a potential flush or straight board. As the hole cards were revealed, Mark shouted out flush, whereupon Simon thought he had lost the hand, but Andrew only had a pair.</p>

<p>Into the second hour, Ben who had been folding most hands, suddenly woke from his coma and bet out on the river, and everyone folded, and of course, accompanied by some choice words by the obstreperous one.</p>

<p>Maan had been ruing some missed opportunities after folding junk cards that would have been the winning combinations, and then also came unstuck against Simon whose trip 10’s took out Maan’s pair of aces.</p>

<p>Maan soon scooped some of the chips though, as Ben was counterfeited on the river after his straight on the turn was overtook by Maan with the river card giving him the winning hand.</p>

<p>With Brian now a “dogs arse” after yet another pre-flop raise, with everyone folding and Brian just happy to take down the blinds.</p>

<p>Andrew was playing with fire, after receiving A-A, and no pre-flop raise, and with Ben coming along for the ride and making a pair of Jacks on the flop. A queen on the turn slowed the betting down, and Andrew saw out the hand ensuring his stack was moving into the right direction.</p>

<p>Andrew (A-J), took on Mark (A-4), on an ace high flop, and after lots of speech play, Andrew shoved all in. Mark was in a tricky spot, but called anyway, and was bereft of chips. Not wanting his night to end, he re-bought into the game.</p>

<p>With what is normally known as the “Nacho’s break”, players were disappointed that Mark had not (for once), brought along his tasty treat, and despite some chatter, uber eats was not summoned upon to remedy the situation.</p>

<p>Into the 3rd hour, with all players still in the game, Brian raised pre-flop with some good hole cards and was now a “Bell end” from Mark, and a “Bastard” from Paul for just playing poker. Tough crowd :)</p>

<p>Carlos was soon delving into his wallet for a re-buy, as Ben wiped him out after hitting top pair on a nine high flop and shoving his remaining chips. The nights first split pot was then shared between Brian (A-J) and Simon (A-7) after the board ran out AQAK3, with both players nervous about straight potentials.</p>

<p>Carlos holding pocket 9’s soon made his new chips work well for him, after getting Simon (A-J) to call on an A-9-3 flop, and then Mark scooped a good pot after his K-J hit a Jack on the flop, with Brian’s A-Q failing to make a pair. “Supergoose” was the new attached name, along with “lets talk about your C*&tishness” - New candidate for inclusion in the Oxford Dictionary.</p>

<p>It wasn’t all chocolates and roses for Mark though, after he received a “fist up the arse” from Andrew, after an ace on the river gave Andrew a better two pair than Mark.</p>

<p>All in season was upon us, with Simon surviving his all in with pocket Queens. Paul was the first player to depart for the night, as his chips were depleted after never really making any great strides in chip collation. Carlos soon followed after Michael had the nut flush on the turn, and Carlos holding two pair, hoping to make a full house by the river.</p>

<p>Ben then moved into a fold or shove strategy, and managed to win two hands in a row with everyone folding, but his third attempt holding A-7, left him exiting in 8th place, after Andrew called with pocket three’s which held out.</p>

<p>Players exiting the game were coming thick and fast, with Simon, and then Mark leaving the game in a dejected state after they could not stop the attack of the never ending blind levels.</p>

<p>The money bubble was now upon the remaining five players, Dave, Brian, Maan, Michael and Andrew, and the usually cool Dave soon took out his frustrations on the table, after folding his mediocre starting cards and then seeing a flop that would have given him a full house. This poker game is so cruel at times.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Dave, he also could not hold on, but left in a respectable 5th place. Brian was next out, after shoving with A-J, but Michael called with A-K, leaving Michael in a strong position to try to eke out his first ever win. In fact, Michael, who historically had thrown away a good chance in a previous game by hitting the turps a bit too strongly, was now ingesting water. Whether the desire to win, or the desire to not be hungover was the driver, we’ll never know.</p>

<p>Maan had been playing a patient strong game, but the nose bleed high altitude blind levels were taking their toll, and ended his game in 3rd.</p>

<p>It was a heads-up battle between the host Andrew, with one previous win, and Michael earnestly hoping to get over the line. With Brian dealing and keeping things ticking over efficiently, a few tense hands were played out with the chips going backwards and forwards, but soon Michael was the chip leader, and when he shoved with top pair, and got called, he was hoping the poker gods would hold their end of the bargain. Fortunately for Michael, the gods were not in the mood for statistical anomalies, and he was crowned the worth victor for the night, and can finally see an entry in the win column on the home page!</p>

<p>Congratulations to Michael, and a big thank you to Andrew for hosting a great night, with a bellyful of laughs and banter.</p>

<p>One game to go. Can Dave overtake Brian on the leader board on the last game?</p>
