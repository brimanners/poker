        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian </h3>
        <p>After the mini winter break, it seems everyone wanted to get back into the poker scene as Steve hosted 9 other players at the 5th event of the 2016 calendar.</p>
        <p>With spring rolls, curry puffs and other savioury treats greeting players upon arrival, it was then backed up with slow cooked lamb with Aldi special rolls
        that were eagerly devoured by the hungry poker dwellers...Ben only managed three this time though, probably wanting to avoid any mention in the notes...
        ooops - too late.</p>

        <h3>First hour</h3>

        <p>With some known late starters, the game commenced with the top four being paid, and Jade taking down the first hand when his King matched a King on the flop and
            beat Mark L and Steve to the pot.</p>

        <p>Michael arrived loaded with inappropriate comments that set the tone of the conversation for the rest of the night, whilst Carlos was getting into the mix by
            raiding Mark V's stack when he hit trip 4's, and got Mark to call his raises.</p>

        <p>The pocket rockets (AA) soon made an apperance much to Brian's delight, but after some bets, calls and checks, he was grateful
        for the win as Michael came along for the ride with pocket 10's, with neither player matching the community cards.</p>

        <p>It was only two hands later, that Brian received pockets aces again, and was grateful for them not to be cracked, after
        taking Mark V along for the ride after Mark matched a Jack on the flop with his AJ. Some players were questioning whether some secret jiggery pokery was
        going down!</p>

        <p>Soon Carlos and Dave were squaring off, both holding two pair by the river, but Carlos coaxing the chips in his direction as his version
        of the hand was higher than Dave's. A few hands later though, and maybe appealing to the laws of karma, Carlos lost with his lower two pair (K3)
        to Steve's two pair (K7).</p>

        <p>Carlos was in a lot of the early battles, and again lost to Steve whose AQ made a straight against Carlos (AK) held yet again two pair.
        Maybe the losses had played with Carlos' mind, as he soon called the initial bet without even looking at his cards!</p>

        <p>Michael was soon into conflict with Steve, after calling Steve who had a pair of kings after the flop and was making some aggressive raises.
            Michael though called each bet and chased down his straight draw by the river, leaving Steve to state that "I don't think he knows what he's doing!"</p>

        <p>The last hand of the first hour had Brian complement his aces with pocket Kings. Raising pre-flop and after the flop taking down the pot
            moved his stack into a healthy state.</p>

        <h3>Second hour</h3>

        <p>Into the second hour, the alcohol was starting to work it's magic, with Steve commenting "I can't stop betting!", but Steve
        did know when to fold his cards after Jade's $1k raise was too strong for Steve to continue.</p>

        <p>Mark V's foray back into the poker world after his long European adventure where Uno was the game of choice was not convinced
        that the pack contained 52 cards. A quick count later confirmed that we were "playing with a full deck"....unlike some players</p>

        <p>Jade had been playing his cards well and folding bad starting cards, but accumulated more chips with A,3 on a scary looking Q 9 3 9 Q board.
        Jade's Ace kicker card with two pair beating Dave to the pot who was trying to get a straight with his J,10. Jade actually had
        three pairs...which is not a legitimate hand..maybe it should be!</p>

        <p>Mark L had been playing various hands leaving opponents confused about his gameplay, and so Mark was happy for Carlos to call his big $5K
        bet after he hit trip 10's against Carlos two pair.</p>

        <p>Shortly after, Andy, Mark V and Dave were fighting out a good pot, on a 9, A, 9, 8, 7 board. Andy had been quite thus far, so Dave
        reluctantly, but correctly folded his pocket queens sensing that someone had an ace or a nine, with Andy winning with his A,10.</p>

        <p>Andy, sporting his beloved New Zealand rugby top whose sponsors were AIG had the crowd offering various versions of what the
        acronymn stood for....Maybe it was actually the supermarket IAG, but the shirt manufacturer employed a dyslexic?</p>

        <p>The quiet assassin Ben had been waiting for a good spot to launch his attack, and soon found his K,10 hitting trips on a K, 5, K flop with Steve and Dave
        also in the hand. Checks all around and the turn produced a 10, giving Ben a full house. Another sneaky check, followed by two more checks
        meant that when an Ace on the river was dealt, there was chance to get some action. And indeed it did. Steve Bet, Dave raised, and Ben re-raised. With Steve
        and Dave both having aces, but not AK, meant all the chips headed to Ben. Well played Ben, and allocated the editors "play of the day" </p>

        <h3>Third hour</h3>
        <p>Into the 3rd hour, with Dave exhausted after works events dealt out 11 players, and Carlos also got back into the action taking some
        of Brian's chips as his trips beat Brian who missed his straight draw.</p>

        <p>Blinds were now starting to cause more players to fold pre-flop, and Steve nearly folded his big blind despite there being no raises, which
        meant he could see the flop for free.</p>

        <p>The likelihood of players exiting the game was now highly likely, and Michael was the first to put his game on the line with all his chips in
        the middle but survived to stay in the game.</p>

        <p>Jade was the next player to go all-in, but his Ace high flush domineered against Mark V's two pair, so he survived and stockpiled chips
        ready for subsequent battles.</p>

        <p>In fact, it was Jade who tooke on the grim reaper role by taking out Mark L, who went from a first place finish at the last event to
        this events lucky last. The next hand, Jade was at it again, this time consigning Mark V to the rail in 9th place. Must be a Mark thing.</p>

        <p>Brian had been nursing a short stack for quite a while, but doubled up after his all in with AK, took out Steve's J,K, with a King on
        board giving him a nervous wait for a Jack to not turn up on the board.</p>

        <p>Again, Michael survives with an all-in with Ace high bluff that had everyone scurrying from the hand.</p>

        <p>Dave had less chips than the required big blind, but survived his all in with a less than optimal 7,3 against Jades 6,4! His good fortune
        continued as he was again all-in with Jade calling on the river and stating "I thought there was another card to come"</p>

        <p>Ben's stack had been eroded by the blinds, and was forced to play the merry all-in dance, but this time the luck ran out and
            was next out in 8th.</p>

        <p>The casualties were now coming thick and fast and we saw the quick successive demise of Carlos, Andy and Steve, who just missed out
            on the cash and is allocated the bubble boy status. It's fair to say the minutes are slightly lacking at this point,
            so if there was some back stories to these players leaving the game, then it's been lost to the ether, or available for recounting
            at the next barbie night.</p>

        <p>And so the it was that the last four remaining players (Dave, Jade, Michael and Brian) had smiles on their faces as they had made the money, and
            their respective families could be fed. Surely, the consistent fourth
        finishing Dave could not continue his statistical anomaly by ending all previous four events in fourth place....
            Hmm, seems not, as Dave was next out, but did recoup some of his initial outlay.</p>

        <p>Alcohol induced bravado, was now the order of the day, when the K, 6, 9 flop gave Brian top pair with his K,8. Jade
        raised, but Brian 3-bet all in. Jade didn't have to deliberate much, and was happy to call after hitting two pair with his K,6. With nothing to help Brian on the
            final two cards, saw Brian exit in 3rd, leaving Michael and Jade heads up for the nights glory.</p>

        <p>Only a few short hands later, Michael had his chips in the middle, and bigger stack Jade called, and managed to
        hold on and take out all of the chips!</p>

        <p>Polar opposites to Mark L, Jade had gone from last place in the previous event to first place...Poker..it's a funny ol' game</p>

        <p>With congratulations a plenty, the ladder now shapes up with Brian sporting a 20 point buffer to Ben in 2nd, closely followed
        by Dave (not in fourth!), with Jade making massive inroads towards to the top end of the ladder.</p>

        <p>A massive thanks to Steve and his family for the letting the event take place. No doubt, the clinking of bottles into the
        recycling bin will put some pressure on the garbage truck come collection time!</p>

        <p>Until the next time.</p>
