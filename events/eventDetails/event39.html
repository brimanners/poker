        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian</h3>


            <p>And so the seventh year of the Augusta Square poker calendar kicked off leaving the safety of the square, venturing to an ex-resident Jade, just a few clicks
            down south in Aspendale. </p>
            <p>After Jade had kindly offered to host and also taxi some of the players to his house, players arrived and were shown the house renovations and also provided some
            tasty meat in cobs (that's rolls for the non-English).</p>

            <p>Despite Brian forgetting the poker cloth, the kitchen table was commandeered and surprisingly did not get any spilt drinks or cards flying off the table.</p>

            <p>Into the action, Ben took down the first hand of 2019 with a $500 pre-flop raise, and continuation betting on the each street, with everyone leaving by the turn, earning Ben
            some early rewards without showing his cards.</p>

            <p>Steve, watching on with interest, then tried exactly the same pre-flop raising strategy, but everyone folded!</p>

            <p>Simon also followed suit with the new standard $500 pre-flop raise, but maybe players just were getting bored folding, and wanted to see some action, as Simon holding (QQ) lost out to Carlos whose 7-2 managed to hit two pair on the flop!</p>

            <p>Brian was winning a few early smallish pots, and Jade took down the nights first decent prize when his pockets 6's hit trips on the flop.</p>

            <p>Now, the host music selections have always been a source of "entertainment", but I think it's fair to say that the backdrop of "Planet Earth", which has been put on
            previously to show off Jade's new 300 ft television was an interesting choice. It was soon changed to a channel playing what was later deemed as the tracks you never heard
            from the 80's... Still, it was better than the sound of seals being eaten by sharks....marginally ;)</p>

            <p>Before the first break, both Jade and Mark V received some of their charity chips, after Ben cleaned them both out with a full house. With the board running out
                4s, 10s, 5c, 10d, 8s, Ben's pocket 5's filled up, with Jade's 4,5 always behind, and Mark V sticking around to make a flush by the river.
                Both received that sinking feeling, as Ben's sneaky checking, calling and betting strategies has enticed both the players to stay in the hand.</p>

            <p>Early into the second hour, with Mark V still licking his wounds, it was not Mark V's night, as Carlos wiped him out. With 4 hearts on the board, Mark shoved a massive amount, with pocket 9's, with his 9
            of hearts making the flush. Carlos didn't deliberate too long, and whose Jack of hearts took all the goodies, and Mark delved into his savings to replenish his chips.</p>

            <p>As been stated on numerous occasions, generally 7-2 (seven deuce), is not what you want to me looking at after you been dealt your hole cards, but for the
            second time of the night, it was the winning hand as Brian took the hand down after no raises pre-flop.</p>

            <p>With Mark V's new chips stacked neatly, he managed to knock Steve off the hand with yet another aggressive bet, and it would have been a split pot as Steve had the same cards (well, obviously, not
                exactly the same - different suits!)</p>

            <p>Steve was not having the luckiest of nights, and as he took into his custody chips from his 3rd win of the night, it was little consolation as all have been of small monetary reward.</p>

            <p>Then the evening got very sombre. What started off as a general question to Carlos about Venenzuela, gave Carlos the opportunity to explain in great
            detail what was going on in his homeland. The clock was stopped, as it was only befitting that Carlos should be given the floor to enlighten us blinkered souls
            on what's actually happening out there in the the cruel real world. It certainly reminded us just how lucky our lives are, with simple things like
            food on the table or even simple things like soap to wash with do not even come into our consciousness. Here's hoping the country moves peacefully forward towards a better place.</p>

            <p>It took a little while for the mood to lighten, but after Ben was accused by Carlos of being like the Majuro after trying to control the game,  Carlos showed
            the evil incumbent dictator who was boss by taking down the hand.</p>

            <p>After the second break, with Simon nursing a small stack, he re-bought into the game after surprisingly the seven deuce did not hold out to Brian's pocket queens.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4" style="float:left;">
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img class="border align-right slide-in" src="../images/2019_02_16.png" alt="" style="float:right;" height="350" width="340"></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="font-size:14pt; align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flopping a straight - great feeling!!<span style="padding-left: 20px;"></span></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

        <p>Carlos was now the chip leader, but after Simon had declared he had not won a hand all night, he took a decent dollop of Carlos' previous winnings when his straight
        smashed Carlos' trips out of the ground.</p>

        <p>And as the blinds now moved peoples stacks toward perilous levels, all in season was upon on. Simon was first to get all his chips in the middle, but his straight
        held against Ben. </p>

        <p>Jade was next to survive from the brink of elimination after Brian's bets effectively put him all in after Brian's ace hit the flop....but with so many outs by the river
            (straight draws, flush draws, two pairs), it was actually harder not to win the hand, and win the hand he did, bringing him back into the game.</p>

        <p>Carlos soon took some of the gloss off Jades' win though, after slowly extracting Jades schip, after his A,5 made a full house by the turn on a 9,9,5,5,3 board.
        Jade was calling his bets with his A-2, hoping that Carlos did not have a 9 or 5, or even an overpair, but the bad news was soon forthcoming</p>

        <p>And it was soon goodnight Vienna for Jade as Steve's A-2 filled up to a full house by the river on a 2, 3, 2, 7, 7 board (seven, deuce anybody?) :) Jade
        had shoved his remaining chips pre-flop with K-2, and Mark V also came along for the ride with A, K, but Steve took ownership of the decent pile of chips
        after only small wins previously.</p>

        <p>Mark V was the next casualty as he was forced to chance his luck with the blinds getting so high.</p>

        <p>Into the third hour, Ben was all in with Q-J. With Brian on the button, he looked down at suited A-8, so didn't deliberate for too long, despite the hand being
            a coin flip, with Brian marginally ahead. Ths statistics gods held their end of the bargain, and Ben was eliminated in 5th place.<p>

        <p>We were now on the cash bubble with Carlos, Steve, Simon and Brian fighting it out for the final placings. Steve pushed Simon off a hand by the turn with the board showing
        Q, K, Q, Q... but Steve mucked his cards. We assume he didn't have a Queen, as no doubt he would have liked to show off quads!</p>

        <p>Carlos was the unlucky Bubble boy going out in 4th after playing an action packed game. And so with the clock heading past midnight, Steve chanced his luck
        but was happy to make the cash for the night with a great effort finishing in 3rd place.</p>

        <p>Simon was ahead in chips for the heads-up battle against Brian, and it was not the first time these two old foes had faced off for the nights big prize.
            Brian was slowly coaxing a few chips towards his side of the table after some aggressive betting, but Simon soon recouped those losses and some after
            hitting trips and beating Brian's two pair.
            </p>

        <p>With the blinds continual ascent to oxygen depleted levels, I'm sure Brian would
        like to say how he played the final hand like a true professional after making a straight on the flop, but the reality was all the chips were already in the middle.</p>

        <p>Simon was unlucky with this A-9 making two pair by the turn, so there was always small possibility on the river, but with a deuce appearing, it was not too be.</p>

        <p>With hand shakes all round, chips stowed, and ubers ordered, we all departed the southern shores, heading back north to the heath community gates, dreaming of the next game</p>

        <p>Big thanks to Jade and his family allowing the game to take place, and another enjoyable game for all, with the obligatory hangovers dealt to the players for the following morning.<p>
