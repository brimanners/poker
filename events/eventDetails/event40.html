        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian</h3>

        <p>We had a full 10 seater table complement arriving at Carlos' for the second event of the 2019 season, with players greeted by some amazing mexican food smells
        to whet the appetite. It wasn't long before the tasty morsels made via the hard work from Carlos' and his wife was soon set-upon and devoured by the hungry pack.
            The sated players then made their way to the table, with stomachs loaded and ready for the nights game.</p>

        <p>The new idea of playing an open hand to find the dealer saw Michael take the honours after hitting quad Jacks, although I'm sure he would have preferred that hand
        later in the night rather than just to find the dealer!</p>

        <p>Paul had the honour of taking down the nights first hand, and Mark L then got into the action with a nice $5,000 pot after hitting a straight and getting
        Andrew L to call his bets after making a pair of Kings.</p>

        <p>Soon, Ben was squaring off against Mark L who was holding pocket Kings. Ben though, had made a straight by the turn card, so Mark's all-in was just music to Ben's ears,
        with Mark L receiving part of his charity chips as a consolation.</p>

        <p>Normally, Brian's annoying cajoling for people to keep their cards on the table is met with derision, but it was Mark L who took on the unfashionable mantle, and pointed out the misdemeanour to Andrew L
        after the hidden cards were missed during the betting rounds. After getting the betting back on track, it didn't stop Ben taking down another enlarged pot, with his straight overtaking Andrew by the river. Mark L offered
        Andrew some condolences along the lines of "If I was a chick, I would bleepety bleep you", and then Ben's non-heath residence was questioned whether he should be allowed to play anyway. </p>

        <p>Andrew L was in a lot of the early action, but was relinquishing chips at a faster rate than an unattended fish and chip shop visited by some hungry orphaned children
            with a background of petty theft (hmmm... I think you know what I mean), as Mark L took some of the spoils after his two pair battered (another chip shop reference?) Andrew's
        pair of aces.</p>

        <p>Into the second hour with charity chips allocated, Michael won a hand, which upon he  requested this momentous event to go into the commentary, which for any discerning readers of
            the start of this sentence can tell, it has indeed been recorded for posterity. </p>

        <p>So instead of bluffing on the poker table, the conversation took on the honours of a bluff, with Dave suggesting he'd pay $4K for a basketball game.
        Even on a lawyers salary, that was some bluff!
        </p>


        <p>Mark V was enjoying some chip gathering after 4 diamonds on the board completed his flush, and one card off a royal flush, which consigned Michael's two pair to
        second place.</p>

        <p>An interesting hand saw Mark V raise to $3,000 pre-flop, and Dave suprisingly folded a premium hand with pocket Queens. Maybe his choice saved him some chips,
        but we'll never know as everyone folded and Mark mucked his cards.</p>

        <p>Andy F had been reasonably quiet, but he did managed to stick around with the turn and river making his flush (known as runner, runner), which led Ben
            shaking his head like an unapproving parent as his two pair was overtaken.
        </p>

        <p>Brian then raised pre-flop with A-K, and with only Dave coming along for the ride with A-3, the K-3,9 flop gave both players something to work with. Brian's bet
        on the flop though was enough to convince Dave not to stick around, and Brian scooped the bounty to keep his chip count heading northwards.</p>

        <p>The last hand of the second hour, or affectionately known as the pre-nachos period, saw Michael all-in with K-4. Unfortunately, it did not hold, so he delved into
            his wallet to re-buy to keep him in the game and swell the prize pool.
        </p>

        <p>With the Nachos devoured (Thanks Mark L), Andrew L was the nights first casualty with not even enough chips to pay the big blind ante. Deciding the call it a
            night, it wasn't long before he was joined by Mark L, after getting all his chips in the middle with A-7, with Paul calling and holding with pocket Jacks.
        </p>

        <p>Carlos, the glorious host was then taken out in 8th place by Brian who again had A-K, which held against J-10.</p>

        <p>All in season was soon upon us, and Michael was the first to try his luck, but took down the blinds and ante's after everyone folded.</p>

        <p>Soon Ben had all his spoils on war in the middle with suited King Queen, but Mark V called with A-2. With Mark slightly ahead pre-flop, it was actually the
        deuce that paired eliminating Ben to the rail</p>

        <p>Andy had decided to take a stand against Brian's aggressive betting style, and his actions were vindicated after he hung around long enough to make
        a pair of sizes by the river, overtaking Brian's paltry pair of fours.</p>

        <p>
            And then probably the biggest hand of the night was played out with Mark L holding pocket aces. With no raises pre-flop, it allowed Michael in the big blind
        holding 9-3 off suit to see the flop. And what a flop it was - 9, 9, 3 giving Michael a full house and Mark two pair!
        Michael shoved his remaining stack, and Mark called. Mark was way behind, and only an ace was going to save him, and whatever he offered up as a sacrificial
        offering to the poker gods must have worked, as the Ace appeared on the turn and it was buenos noches Michael.
        </p>

        <p>We were now on the money bubble, and it was Paul who unluckily missed out of the cash windfall after not picking up any good cards at the pointy end of the
        tournament.</p>
        <div class="col-lg-4" style="float:left;">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img class="border align-right slide-in" src="../images/2019_03_01b.png" alt="" style="float:right;" height="350" width="340"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="font-size:12pt; align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cry me a river.....<span style="padding-left: 20px;"></span></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>With dollar signs in their eyes, Brian's stack was getting blinded out, so shoved his remaining chips with Q-5 on a Queen high flop (Q-9-6). With two callers
        Andy (A-J) and Mark V (A-9), Brian was still in front, despite a Jack appearing on the turn to pair Andy's cards.
        The river though is a cruel mistress, and with another ace appearing, it gave Mark a pair of aces, but Andy scooped all the Mula with two pair.
        </p>

        <p>The three remaining players soon became two, with Mark V going out in a very respectable 3rd place, leaving Andy and Dave to fight it out for the nights honours.</p>

        <p>Andy was still seeking that first elusive win with two previous second place finishes, and Dave was hoping to have a win away from the shack to prove he
        could win on the road. It was a tentative heasds up battle with lots of folding and no large pots, but maybe as the night progressed and tiredness took over,
        Andy's folding and waiting for a premium hand was diminishing his chips due to the massive blind levels. Andy was eventually forced to call off Dave's
        bets, and unfortunately for Andy, he lost the hand and took the silver medal.</p>

        <p>So a nice first prize pool monetary reward could be used by Dave to bankroll his backetball ticket, whilst Andy should still be proud of going so deep in the
        tournament.</p>

        <p>So, once again, muchas muchas sinceras gracias must go to Carlos and his family for allowing the event to take place. See you at the next event at Simons!
