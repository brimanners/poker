<p>Nine players eventually made it to Ben's for the third installment of Season 2018.</p>
<p>After the usual array of superb dining options (thanks to Mrs Ingham); it was time to play…</p>

    <p>Now, it's been four weeks since we did this … with the fading memory of the night, here is what I can remember:</p>

    <p><b>First session:</b></p>

    <p>Second hand of the night made Augusta Square Poker History - Mark V somehow splaying all the cards on the floor.</p>
    </p>Four or five hands later we realised that we were only playing with 51 cards due to the splaying.  And I won two of those hands.  So there were some conspiracy theories being floated by this point.   For the record, it was the nine of clubs that was missing... And it would have been good to know that.</p>
    <p>Dave won a big hand - QQ facing off against Paul</p>
<p>We went three way - Jade v Paul v Michael.  Paul didn't know what was going on with both going all in against his full house.  Wowee</p>
<p>Paul backs up the hand with two pair again Kevin, then gets Michael again with his Aces.</p>

        </tr>
    </table>

<p><b>Second session:</b></p>

<p>Jade was building up his chip lead by this point - and took down Andy's full house with one of his own</p>
<p>Andy was a late starter - but ended up being first to finish as well.  Out at 8:56 - not quite a record for Augusta Poker (Andrew L and Jade are joint holders with 8:30)… but still impressive… if you think that kind of thing is impressive.</p>
<p>I had a losing hand against Michael - with his Aces again holding up against my QK.</p>
<p>Mark V started a run of six hands in a row … yep it can be an easy game sometimes.</p>


<p><b>Later on…</b></p>

<p>I got Michael a good one with my sixes taking down JQ.  In fact Kev was in the hand as well with 6 9.  I think there was Jack on the flop...  And then the last six came out.  Then Michael called me a name.</p>
<p>Brian then got me good.  I had a two pair against a flopped straight.  Yep I went all in on that.</p>
<p>Soon after that, we all started going out … but Dave managed to not come fourth again … by coming fifth.</p>
<p>It then ended up being the Mark V and Brian show going back and forth for several hands.</p>
<p>The last hand must have been interesting … Mark V had a KK against Brian's 48.  Without remembering all the detail… Mark must have been slow playing the second best starting hand against one of the worst.  However any two cards can win… and Brian's two pair did it in the end.</p>


<p>So Brian is now comfortably on top of the ladder and with a hot streak now not seen in Augusta Poker History with four wins from the last five events;  it's looking like a three peat.</p>
