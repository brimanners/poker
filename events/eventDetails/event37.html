    </p>




<p>So, it was decided to take a night off on the commentary, so the following will just be some random bunch of words, mangled together,
    based loosely on the truth, and whose accuracy will definitely fade as the night's recollections move towards the end of the game.</p>
<div class="col-lg-4" style="float:right;">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><img class="border align-right slide-in" src="../images/20181013.png" alt="" style="float:right;"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="font-size:8pt; align: center;">      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..... Front loading at the brewery! ...........<span style="padding-left: 20px;"></span></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>I blame it on the excellent idea at the time to start the nights game with a trip to the brewery. On a glorious Saturday afternoon in the late
afternoon sunshine, it seemed the whole of Rye had come along to meet us. The overflow carpark was overflowing, but that would not deter the
thirsty players enjoying some tasty local brews and enjoying the views of which there were many!</p>

<p>With a coin toss determining the pre-game food, locally caught fish (probably) was complemented with non-poker chips (definitely), before the
four eager players could start the game. The numbers may have been down, but it didn't stop an excellent night of cards with lots of twists and turns</p>

<p>There wasn't a lot of folding going on, with lots of pots going to players who had only made one pair. There were split pots. There was both players getting
full houses. Flushes? - yep, had those. Chasing straights - check. 5 cards of the same suit on the board - Check, check! Busted Aces - double check. All ins.. Ben made many of these, including
several late on to keep him in the tournament.</p>

<p>With no specific hands documented, let's just go with the vibe of the thing. It went something along the lines of.. Brian just getting lucky,
hitting trips, straights and flushes and only folding pre-flop twice in the first 3 hours! Any two cards can win. Ben trying to buy some pots, but
getting "rivered".. yeah, it's now officially a verb.. and it hurts.... a lot. Paul and Dave squaring off and chips going to and fro. </p>

<p>Ben was sailing close to the wind, but his multiple all-ins kept him in the game after so nearly going for a re-buy...but late on, it
was anyones game. Brian got his aces cracked keeping Dave in the game, Paul knocked people off pots with some aggressive betting, but at some point someone had to go out</p>

<p>Paul, got it in good, but lost - details... hmm, yeah, nah... Unlucky Paul, and his first wooden spoon allocation after 26 games! Only Junior has
not lost a game (only including players with at least 10 games). So most of us know how it feels, but with only 4 players, the likelihood increased dramattically!</p>

<p>Dave was happy not to get 4th place, and was hoping the statistic of his only wins, both coming on home territory, might get him over the line, but
alas, not this time</p>

<p>Brian and Ben went into battle with comparable chip stacks, and after several hands with both players taking the lead, Brian shoved with something mediocre. No-idea
what Ben had, but he won, after coming back from the brink of back to back last places!</p>


<p>.. and whoever thought having that last beer was a good idea.. Oh, that was me.. but with Bacon and Eggs at a cafe the next morning, the hangover is finally
receding. Time for a beer!</p>


<p>Congrats to Ben. Muchas Gracias to Dave for hosting. You can take away our poker players, but you can never take our game!</p>

<p>See you for the final game up the hill at Mark L's</p>
