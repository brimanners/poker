        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian </h3>
        <p>
            The final game of the 2015 championship was held at a new venue, with 7 players venturing to Carlos’ house to indulge in some tasty
            pre-game Chilli con carne, prepared the day before to allow the spices to shine.
        </p>

        <p>
            With players praising the culinary offering (and some asking whether Carlos' wife had made it!), the game commenced with main storyline of the championship
            winner on the line. Ben was sporting a 5 point gap to Steve in second place, and with not enough points on offer,
            Brian in third place could only leapfrog Steve into second place if results went his way. Simon was chosen as the super bonus recipient,
            and with seat allocation and dealer chosen, the game could commence.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first had saw Simon take down the pot with his pocket deuces (two’s), hitting a two on the flop, and with Jade only making pair of Kings by the river,
            Simon increased his stack with a reasonable allocation of Jades initial chip allocation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Only into the third hand, we witnessed the night’s first full house after Brian’s 2,10 complemented the 2, 2, J, 10 board.
            With Steve’s also holding a deuce meant he had trips, so Brian gratefully took down the goodies after getting Steve to call his bets.
            In fact, the deuces were appearing in most hands, leading players to wonder if they should always play the hand if they were dealt a deuce.
        </p>

        <p>
            Simon and Jade seemed to end up in battles in a lot of early pots, with Jade taking down a good size prize after his Ace finished the nut flush.
            It wasn’t long before Simon was bereft of chips, as his luck run out when he held pocket 7’s on a J K 7 board.
            With Steve receiving pocket Jacks and Brian holding pocket Queens, the betting ferocity intensified. Brian sensed a case of foreboding with a King on the
            board and jettisoned from the hand leaving Steve to deal the killer blow to Simon, who received a portion of his charity chips as a result.
        </p>

        <p>
            Into the second hour with chip stacks replenished, the beer was starting to flow leading up to Steve forgetting to look at his cards
            before asking how much the bet was. Or maybe he was just so confident that he would win anyway?
        </p>

        <p>
            Ben, who probably had the ladder position in the back of his mind, had been playing tight so far, but soon started to loosen up, as he received AK.
            With Steve holding A4, and an Ace appearing on the flop, led to a big win for Ben, who was relishing taking out some chips from his championship ladder competitor.
        </p>

        <p>
            Carlos then received a nice chip reward, as his 2 diamonds matched 2 diamonds on the flop although Brian’s A,10 and Juniors A,J also
            hit the A,4,6 board. Carlos took down after the board revealed another diamond on the river and then spilt his drink on the table in the excitement.
        </p>

        <p>
            Steve soon replenished his stack with pocket 5’s, after squaring off against Brian's A4, and Simon’s AQ, after the flop showed 8,K,A.
            Despite being behind after the flop and some reasonable betting, he stayed in the hand and his choice was vindicated when the turn showed a 5 completing his set.
            Both Brian and Simon thought they were still in with a chance, and with yet another 5 appearing on the river, Steve now had quad’s! Steve betted
            well to extract a few more chips from his combatants, before contentedly stored the pot as a result. If memory serves the commentator correctly,
            only Paul has had the honour of quads before, way back at the first game at Daves shack.
        </p>

        <p>
            Junior had been very quiet for the first hour or so, but then starting to bet on every street. Carlos’ Ace hit the flop, and he called Juniors bets.
            An even larger bet on the river had Carlos scratching is head, and after some deliberation folded expecting Junior to be holding the winning cards.
            Junior proudly tabled 8,9 which did not hit the board and provided the biggest (known) bluff of the night.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another hand with four of the same suit by the turn gave Carlos a flush, with Ben reluctantly folding his top pair.
            The very next hand provided Junior with the same 4 card flush as his K,7 hearts knocked Brian off the pot, despite his pocket 7’s
            giving him trips on the 7h,4h,9h,3h,4s board.
        </p>

        <p>
            Carlos then happily received pocket Kings, but with no raise pre-flop, Simon came along for the ride with J,9. The flop showed J,J,2, and with a
            9 on the turn meant Simon full house showed no mercy to Carlos' good starting cards.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the time approaching 9pm, the first casualty of the night was Jade, who pushed his remaining chips in the middle after having two pair by the turn card.
            Junior was on a flush draw, but called Jade’s large bet anyway. With the final card making his flush, Jade decided not to re-buy and to call it quits for the
            night, hoping to get a nap in before his 2am date with his beloved table topping Leicester playing Manchester United. Of course,
            his departure did include some choice words (you know the ones) about the poker game.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the second break, the return of the ante’s creating the usual “have you put your ante in?” type questions with Ben forgetting several times,
            but was probably distracted as he  worked out the statistical probabilities of finishing on top of the ladder.
        </p>

        <p>
            Junior was now starting to gather some momentum taking out several hands in a row with good raises, and of course the pocket deuces also
            returning to the game play. With both Brian's and Carlos’ stacks in the danger zone, they both chanced their luck with some
            reasonable cards pre-flop by getting their remaining chips in the middle. Junior though took out both players, but both Carlos and Brian
            both decided to re-buy in the hope of turning around their fortunes. This was not what Ben was hoping for though, as he knew that he needed
            less players to guarantee more points.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ben was daydreaming about seeing his his name on the winners trophy, as Steve's chip stack was now moving into the danger zone. Steve was wondering
            whether to decrease his stack below the re-buy minimum, as the re-buy period was soon coming to an end, but instead won a reasonable pot from
            Ben to put himself back in contention.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the third break, the final placings were going to be decided. It wasn’t long before Brian had his chips in the middle after his A,10, hit
            the 10, 8, 6 board. With Carlos on a flush draw and Simon on a straight draw meant the massive pot went to Carlos after the turn made his flush,
            and consigning Brian to 6th place for the night, but confirming the championship bronze medal.

        <p>
            With Brian taking on the dealing responsibility, we witnessed the biggest hand of the night as Ben shoved his good sized stack when he received A,J of
            diamonds. Other players folded to Steve, whose 10,2 off suit is not normally a hand that players favour. Knowing that if he got lucky, he could take out
            Ben, and could make of break his charge to the top prize. Conversely, if he were to lose, it would leave him perilously close to elimination.
            Deciding to gamble, he called, players gasped with anticipation and Brian dealt out all of the cards face down, and slowly revealed each card one at a time.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First card - 8 - nada for Steve</li>
            <li>Second card - 4 zilch for Steve</li>
            <li>Third card - 4 nowt for Steve</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Steve was starting to fear the worst. Ben was now starting to breathe again, and then Brian turned over the next card:
        </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn - Another 4 - Ben was one card away from making himself the massive favourite to take out the season.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            With both players now having trips, Steve needed a 10 or a 2……
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>River - <b>A TEN!!!!!</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The room erupted with noise, as Ben was taken out in 5th place and received 3 points as result. Steve had received a massive dollop of luck at the
            right time, but Ben took the knockout blow on the chin, knowing that he could still win if Steve did not make the top 2 places.
        </p>

        <p>
            The final 4 players, Junior, Carlos, Simon and Steve were now on the cash bubble, and the super bonus was also still active.
            These seemed sub-plots to the main event, with Steve needing to hold on to take out the seasons championship.
            Blinds were biting at the players ankles like a pit bull on red bull, and soon Simon chanced his luck with his remaining chips, but
            Junior took down the pot to move him into the clear chip leader.
        </p>

        <div class="col-lg-4" style="float:right;">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img class="border" src="../images/20151128_carlos_b.png" alt="" style="float:right;"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="font-size:8pt; align: center;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">2014 Champion Brian hands over the trophy the 2015 champion Steve!
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>
            Only one more exit would mean Steve being crowned the champion, and an all-in from Carlos meant the time had come to decide the seasons fate.
            Carlos’ re-buy had meant he at least had recouped some of his outlay, but he resigned himself to third spot after his cards didn’t hold out.
            <b>Steve had done it!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            With congratulations to Steve on getting enough points, the more relaxed heads up between Steve and Junior took a few hands to play out,
            with lots of folding and small raised meaning both stacks did not take a massive hit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Soon though, both had reasonable cards, and with all chips in the middle, Junior took out the nights first prize and resigned
            Steve to a second place finish, and not allowing Steve three consecutive first places finishes.
        </p>

        <p>
            What a night. You have to feel for Ben, who was very unlucky to be knocked out by Steve’s call, but that’s poker,
            which can be a cruel mistress. He should be proud of his achievements though, and does have the consolation of
            yet another season podium finish and takes out the well deserved silver place. The main accolades have to go to Steve though,
            as two firsts and a second place finish in the final three games make him a worthy season champion, and his win comes despite
            having the same amount of points as Ben, but playing one less game means he takes out the coveted prize.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, a massive thanks to Carlos and his family to allow the event to take place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here’s hoping the 2016 calendar event throws up some more exciting games.
