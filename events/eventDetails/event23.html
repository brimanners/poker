        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian </h3>


        <p>Six players turned up laden with alcohol and snacks to Brian's house who had supplied pizza's for the usual pre-game readiness. </p>

        <p>After devouring the offerings, players moved on the poker game with three players chosen for the super bonus (Brian, Paul and Mark). It was
        Paul's first game of the season, but he was also up against Mark who had had great hunting grounds at Brian's with his previous three
        wins all coming at the location.</p>

        <p>The nights game was marked with an increase level of aggressive betting pre-flop, showcased on the first hand with Ben was raising 3 times the
            big blind from "under the gun" (the first person to act pre-flop). This positional raise normally has "Danger Will Robinson" all over it and
        everyone bar Paul jettisoned from the hand. Despite some checking post flop, Ben bet on the river and Paul reluctantly folded.</p>

        <p>Ben must have really missed winning poker hands after being absent from the previous event, and also took out the second hand taking down the pot
        with a better two pair than Steves.</p>

        <p>Paul was also getting in on the action after taking down the 3rd hand and proudly enquiring about which players had won a hand.</p>

        <p>Mark had been swotting up on the game after watching late night poker on Channel 31 and was starting to raise pre-flop and then continuation
        betting on the flop and taking down 3 hands in a row (TV time well spent!). He did relinquish some of the chips to Steve though, as Steve's trip sixes took no pity on
        Mark's pair of aces.</p>

        <p>Paul was now starting to swell his chip stack after receiving some good cards and winning several hands. He did come unstuck
        against Mark though, who managed to get Paul to call his $1000 river bet, with Paul's pair no match for Mark's two pair</p>

        <p>Into the second hour, with charity chips allocated to everyone's stack, Ben won two hands in a row against Paul, both via having
        a better kicker card. In fact, Paul was involved with most of the action, and restocked his chip pile after flopping a straight and getting
        Brian to call his raises. Soon after, Brian and Paul were squaring off, with both players holding K-10 on a board showing two K's. Some
        pychological warfare with raises, re-raises and calls gave each player a poker adrenaline rush, but the split pot returned heartbeats to healthy
        BPM limits.</p>

        <p>Brian, who had been quiet thus far in the evenings proceedings and only won one hand, then managed to hit the nights first full house after
        the river completed his hand. Betting for value, he did manage to extract some chips back from Paul, leading to Paul stating "I'm not enjoying
        playing against you". And to to rub salt into the wounds, Brian raided Paul's stack for even more spoils of war after Brian's trip Kings
        took out Pauls pocket sevens.</p>

        <p>The final hand of the second hour saw Dave finally win a pot, after he had folded the majority of his hands pre-flop due to the
           junk getting dealt. His moment in the sun saw his take down the big blind as no raises pre-flop and to the river. Probably not
        a hand for that will last long in the memory.</p>

        <p>The third hour saw the increased blind levels starting to sway players decision making, but the nights pocket rockets (AA) visited Mark
        who squared off against Steve holding pocket 9's. With two Jacks on the board slowing the betting down, but Mark was
        grateful to accept all the chips as his aces held.</p>

        <p>With Dave still folding most hands pre-flop after receiving yet more less than optimal starting cards, he was happy to receive
            pocket 7's in the big blind. With no raises, he limped into the pot, and lo and behold the flop ran out 7,7,8 giving
            him quads!. Keeping a good poker face despite some comments about well that would be nice if Dave had seven deuce, he lured some
            players into his trap. Maybe the all-in on the turn was a bit strong as he could have extracted a few more chips rather than making
            everyone fold, but at least he won the good size pot after a night of disciplined poker patience.
            It was always going to be the best hand of the night and one of the best hands of the August Square history.....Straight flush or royal flush must come
            and visit us at some point!
        </p>

        <p>Amazingly, into the fourth hour and everyone was still in the game, although Steve and Paul's stacks were heading into the danger zone.
            Another battle of the blinds saw Steve's 6-2 come unstuck to Dave's 5-2 when Dave hit the 5 on the river. Any win was now gratefully
            received as the ante's and blinds were creating monster pots.
        </p>

        <p>Another hand that caused plenty of deliberation was with Brian holding pocket 5's against Ben who had woken up with American Airlines
        (pocket Aces). The board ran out Q, Q, 3 and Brian bet the flop hoping that Ben didn't have a queen. Ben pushed all in leaving Brian to
        reached into his inner poker psychology to try to get a read on Ben. Whether a good read or just a stack protection move (Brian got scared),
        he correctly folded as Ben tabled his aces.</p>

        <p>Despite the late hour, and with all player still in the game, Steve now found himself lower in chips than a tenor's voice and
        could only post half of the big blind. No luck was forthcoming and Steve was the first player out.</p>

        <p>Brian then gratefully eyed pocket Aces and bet pre-flop, but there were no takers, so he only won the blinds and antes.</p>

        <p>Brian also then pushed Dave onto the brink with trip eights after this eight matched two eights on the board. Despite Dave's
        perilous position, he did survive on the next hand after hitting an Ace on the river, giving him a straight against Ben's two pair. </p>

        <p>Paul's early stack building was also coming undone, but he replenished his chip pile after winning two hands in a row at the
        time of night that any win was a profitable result.</p>

        <p>Mark's early aggressive playing style had been paying dividends, but he also became the next casualty after trying his luck
        with his remaining chips, exiting the game in fifth place. Three wins out of four at Brian's is still a good return though.</p>

        <p>The cash bubble was upon us, and with the perennial fourth place finishing bubble boy Dave hoping not to end with the same fate, tried
        his luck by getting all the chips in the middle. Not to upset the gods of consistency, his cards could not hold, and resigned himself
        to his third fourth place finish of the season.</p>

        <p>With two bounty selected players still in the mix (Brian and Paul) they fought it out with Ben to sort out the top three placings</p>

        <p>Soon, Ben and Paul were in a pot, but Ben's aggressive betting made Paul fold with Paul stating "I would have probably won that".
        Ben's retort "Yes, probably", meant the psychological warfare was increasing. </p>

        <p>Ben, knowing it was the time of the night to strike with any good starting cards, got all his chips in the middle with Jack, Queen.
        Brian's larger stack had some protection and so he called with King Ten suited. The flop gave Brian a flush (one card off making a straight
        flush), so Ben was resigned to the nights bronze medal, but getting the extra bonus points to help his ladder position. </p>

        <p>And so it was Paul or Brian who were to take out the nights honours, including the super bonus that had accumulated nicely
        over the previous 18 months. Brian was the clear chip leader, and it wasn't long before Brian had trips yet again after his K-4 matched
        two kings on the board. Luring Paul into his trap, he checked the flop, but bet the river enough to put Paul all-in. Paul had a pair,
        and after Brian first showed his four, paused, and then delivered the final blow turning over the King.</p>

        <p>Another great night of poker with all players staying in the game until the latter stages. Paul's first foray back into the
        season sees him go straight into a respectable mid table position. Brian's first win since December 2014 tops the ladder 9 points
        ahead of Ben who moves up to 2nd place but has played one less game. Simon's abscence means he drops to 3rd, and it's not
        difficult to work out who is in 4th - Consistent Dave!</p>

        <p>Looking forward to the next exciting installment of the felt.</p>
