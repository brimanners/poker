        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Mark L </h3>
    </p>


    <p>Well, well, well …. What a start! … Freesey's lost 24 Kg's and looks a million dollars. Ben - recently retired is bathing in a million dollars and we dined on some pulled pork that tasted a million dollars..</p>

    <p>But - that's not the 'What a start' that matter … what about this for a bit of poker history.</p>

    <p><b>After 4 hands … yep, only 4 deals - Mark L and Michael were out!</b></p>

    <p>Whack, whack!</p>

    <p>A disgraceful re-entry from Leopold in his first appearance for the year; getting smacked by Ben with a 3 of a kind</p>

    <p>Alas, there is method to the madness because losing so early also means you get back in early … gratis</p>

    <p>Leopold back then smacks Raich's clacker and bang he's out now. Chew.On.That.</p>

    <p>The table looked on quizzically - who are these mad men?</p>

    <p>Michael then gets more chips and bang! 4 of a kind - he's back with a vengeance</p>

    <p>Michael and Mark then pretend this is part of some grand plan.</p>

    <p>Before Brian puts a finger up Leopold's clacker and nearly cleans him out again with 2-pair.  Leopold is not impressed with Brian's finger-style so he whacks back - but at an easier target - dropping one into wombats date and knocking him out with a 2 pair. Bye, bye Simon. Get some more free chips.</p>

    <b>Yep, 3 people out before the first break … Poker has seen nothin' like it.</b></p>

    <p>Meanwhile ….Ben and Mark V started strong and confident. Brian shakes his head … Freesey dreams of eating more lettuce and dropping another few kegs.</p>

    <p><b>Break</b></p>


    <p>It then went from strange too weird for a while.</p>

    <p>A few people launched out a few classic lines</p>

    <p>"I'd rather knock one out on the bathroom than watch that rugby."</p>
    <p>I'd shag a rolling donut."</p>

    <p>Michael started to talk about widgets and beer</p>

    <p>We played kinda normally for about 3 minutes and 28 seconds.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile ….Ben and Mark V continue their strong and confident approach. Brian continues to shake his head … Freesey dreams of eating lentils and dropping another few kegs.</p>

    <p>Then Wombat and Leopold started trading in proper poker again but somehow I stuffed it completed. He and I had heaps in … but then the dingleberry showed me his cards and I felt bad so I tried to say - it's yours... here's what I was going to bet - you've got me… then Brian and Ben and indeed the whole table point out that no, I have won with a flush and then it all gets a bit religious. No one wants to do the wrong thing and we half the pot like animals dressed as gentleman do.</p>

    <p>Yep, it got weird</p>

    <p>Best summed up by Simon. "It's like shagging your sister …." Actually - it's a sick quote that this author is unprepared to write.</p>

    <p>Back to poker</p>

    <p>Mark V beat Ben Yep, Really!!! 3 queens (his second 3 of a kind in row)</p>

    <p>Then it's bend over ben because Riach beat Ben too - a full house to ben's two pair.</p>

    <p>Ben … then sucks a lemon for a while (but he'll be back) and Riach does a wombat and tries to push out his chest - not quite the same effect as Wombat but it passes for a manly play.</p>

    <p><b>Break</b></p>

    <p>Bang!!!!!!!</p>

    <p><b>The greatest hand in Heath poker history - A straight flush … is not even noticed by the chest puffer Riach</b></p>

    <p>Yep, he wins a hand in a wet lettuce kinda way - not knowing he had a straight flush … just knowing he had something.</p>

    <p>This is a highlight for the author … because I remembered not see a flush earlier … so this kind of made me feel OK.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile ….Ben and Mark V seem to be flagging. Brian continues to shake his head … Freesey dreams of drinking tepid water and dropping another few kegs.</p>

    <p>Now things happen fast and slow.</p>

    <p>Somewhere here we had a break and knocked back some nachos</p>

    <p>Simon loses with three aces - Ben had queen high to add to his three aces.</p>

    <p>Mark V goes all in twice in a few hands  … and wins. Excellent play by Mark</p>

    <p><b>Riach tries his best to go home …. But Wins and sends Simon out first Wombat 7th. Bang!</b></p>

    <p>He's not sour about it at all - losing magnanimously "Hey Mark V, are you Ok? You wouldn't know what this time of night feels like normally."</p>

    <p>Now it's Andy all in but wins a smallish pot because he a didn't have much coin and the secondary pot was quite large and Leopold was lucky to get the chocolates over Mark V - a straight beat Mark V's aces</p>

    <p><b>Bang -- Andy out 6th  - finally he's out of his misery and can think of eating a carrot and losing a few more kegs.</b></p>

    <p><b>Bang -- Mark V out (5th) to Mark L. </b> Reasonable play this …. Mark v had aces but Mark L had a straight early and lured the fish to the pond. Mark V was left flapping around on the deck.</p>

    <p>Boringness was endured for a while</p>

    <p>Bang - Michael out …not sure how 4th</p>

    <p>Boringness for a while</p>

    <p><b>Then Bang. Boom. Pow.</b></p>

    <p>Brian - still shaking his head wondering what happened tonight - Leopold and Ben are left …

    <p>Brian goes all in, I match, then Ben went nuts and <b>Kapow!</b> - all three of us are all in!</p>


    <p>I am not sure what happened but</p>

    <p>Brian is 3rd, Leopold 2nd and Ben wins!!</p>

    <p>Well done Ben, well done all.</p>
