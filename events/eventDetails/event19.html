        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian </h3>

        <p>
            With players venturing to Paul’s abode, the 10 seater table was back to the the location of it’s unveiling almost two years ago prior. It may have a few stains, minor rips after seeing lots of action, but it’s still going strong (That’s the table, not a reference to one of the players, although the lots of action seems okay).</p>

        <p>
            The ladder before the game had Ben sporting a healthy lead, knowing that he could effectively seal the championship with a strong performance, assuming the chasing pack did not pick up too many points.
        </p>

        <p>
            With players stomachs happy recipients of Paul’s culinary skills and Michael chosen as the target for the engorged super bonus, the game could commence, and lo and behold, it got off to a flyer. Carlos, Brian and Mark L were in the hand after the flop offered K, J, 8. Brian raised with pair of Kings, Carlos called, and Mark L shoved all in. Was this early bravado, eagerness to go home, or had Mark actually hit the flop? Carlos and Brian both decided that even Mark L (who does like the self-title of a madman), would not be this mad. And so it proved, as he tabled J-8.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second hand saw Brian lose over half of his initial stack, as his strong bets did not push Jade off his cards. Brian with pocket queens, hit a queen on the flop, but Jade’s two diamonds were now four diamonds by the turn, and five by the river. A final $1,000 bet by Jade meant Brian reluctantly called just to confirm what he thought Jade might have, and Jade’s flush took down a the decent pot as a result. Nice chase Jade.
        </p>

        <p>
            And the trifecta of big hands was completed with Ben’s pocket Kings squaring off against Jade’s A-Q on a Q, 10, 10, 6, 9 board. Needless to say, some of those chips that left Brian didn’t stay long at Jades residence seeking pastures new at Ben’s side of the table. But not to be deterred, Jade was playing a lot of hands winning a few, losing a few to keep his chip stack at a healthy status, including knocking Paul off the pot after a strong bet with his two pair of Aces and Sevens.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mark L then joined in the affray with a big $1,000 bluff attempt, that Michael and Carlos called. Another $1K push on the river soon caught Mark L with his hands in the cookie jar, as Michael took down the pot with his pair of aces. Not to be deterred by the exposed bluff, Mark L was soon all in with two pair, but this time did have a strong hand and won the pot against Steve whose pair of 9’s were not good enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe it’s a Mark thing, but then another bluff that went catastrophically wrong was provided by Mark V trying to steal some chips on a JJ6 board. Jade called with his six, and Mark was caught with his pants down (hopefully metaphorically speaking), and received part of his chip up before the break. It wasn’t long before his namesake Mark L was also devoid of chips, and also received some charity chips.
        </p>

        <p>
            Into the second session, with the philanthropic benefaction of new playing chips, Michael must have been feeling a bit too cashed up as his massive 10K raise with pocket Kings was not called, and he only won a small pot compared to what could have been if he brought others along for the ride. Although, some would argue that any won pot is a good pot, so maybe it was the right move.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the biggest hands of the night saw Steve with Q-3 go up against Mark L’s 10,5 on a Q-10-Q flop. With another 10 on the turn, the betting grandiosity intensified, as Steve's higher full house of Queens full of 10’s against Mark’s 10’s full of queens, meant that only a 10 on the river would save Mark. The King of the river helped no-one, and with all of Mark L’s chips now in the middle, Steve bloated his chip stack, and with the night only early into the second hour, Mark L went searching for some more cash to re-buy into the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dave had been playing his patient game for most of the night, but soon received pocket Kings. Taking Paul along for the ride on a K-J-4-J-6 board, he relieved Paul of some of his chips, as Paul’s K and two pair was no match for yet another of the nights full houses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Steve was soon in another hand as he gratefully received the pocket rockets AA. Jade was also happy to see two Jack’s in the hole cards, but neither an Ace or Jack materialised on the board, so Steve took down the reasonable pot.
        </p>

        <p>
            A $30,000 pot then headed to Paul to keep his stack healthy, as his A-J took down Mark V’s pocket deuces and Michael’s pocket 9’s after an ace was produced on the flop.

            The old foes Michael and David were also soon squaring off with Michael’s two pair not enough to see off Dave’s trip sixes. Michael, not discouraged by this loss, and starting to loosen up after a few “home made” servings of his beverage of choice instigated the first casualty of the night. Not able to recoup the early losses from both exposed bluffs and unlucky lower full houses, Mark V was shunted from the game, after his pocket sevens did not hold out against Michael’s pair of Queens.
        </p>

        <p>
            With Mark V taking on the dealing responsibility, we witnessed what had to be the hand of the night with the all action Michael up against Mark L. With the board showing four diamonds (5-3-8-7), Mark thought he was as good as nun at a charity shop with his Ace of diamonds completing the nut flush. An all in from Mark would double his chip stack, but Michael had other ideas. Despite not having any diamond, he was holding two pair with a 7 and 8, meaning that any 7 or 8 would complete his full house. The decision making may have been influenced by the alcohol, and despite being a 9-1 underdog, Michael called…..and the river was a 7 of spades. The cacophony of noise was probably heard in the CBD as amazed players shook their heads in disbelief, but Mark L smiled, accepted the players applause and magnanimously accepted his fate.

            The blinds and antes were now tormenting peoples stack, and with players close to elimination, it wasn’t long before Carlos was out in 8th. Michael’s massive stack was then amplified by taking out Paul’s remaining chips, resigning the host into 7th place.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second break soon saw some snacks being offered after Mark L had kindly made Nacho’s. Some of the left of centre comments made about the ingredients did have some players pondering whether to actually indulge. The commentator can vouch for the quality though, and was dismayed that there was nothing left after going back for a second serve. Excellent “Salsa Blanca”.
        </p>

            Ben had been quiet for while, and the ladder leader needed to avoid being blinded out, and shoved all in. Everyone assumed he had been patiently waiting for some good cards, but bounteous chip laden Michael called, and Ben sheepishly tabled his 8-10. The chasing pack on the ladder were licking their lips in anticipation of an early exit, but Ben’s quiet word with Lady luck saw him double up after getting a full house by the river.
        </p>

        <p>
            A guest visitor then arrived with Simon turning up in the gallery to spectate after missing the game due to family commitments and big trucks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dave was the next victim, after he also shoved his remaining chips after hitting top pair of Queens on the flop. Not shying away from most hands, Michael called, and managed to river a straight to eliminate Dave in 6th.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the cash bubble now showing it’s presence, the next player to exit would just miss out on the cash. Michael had become the nights grim reaper, so he continued the trend by taking out bubble boy Jade in fifth place, despite Jade's 10,2 hitting top pair on a board of 10-3-7. Jade was pushing in chips, but Michael was just calling, and by the river, Michael dealt Jade the bad news, as he turned over pocket Aces. This left Michael the clear chip leader, with the super bonus still very much alive to finally go off. What could stop the Michael juggernaut?
        </p>

        <p>
            Normally, the commentary has a spot for Jade when it come’s to the best on ground moniker with regard to inebriation, but Michael's stellar performance in this category signalled the start of the downfall. We were all informed about the strength of his drink (numerous times), some difficulty with chip denominations (probably exacerbated by the volume in front of him - we were just jealous), protesting about the rules when cards were inadvertently misdealt (mistakes happen, and the rules are there to resolve), but no-one could argue with his chip count as it looked on imperiously at Brian’s, Steve’s and Ben’s stacks.
        </p>

        <p>
            It wasn’t long though before cracks started to appear, and Steve soon took a large segment of the Michael's stack with his pocket 10’s, and Brian also picked off some the monster stack with a pair of K’s. Ben was hoping to indulge in the feeding frenzy, but instead came up against Steve. Previous winner Steve was getting used to the winning feeling, and kept up the momentum taking out Ben in 4th place, but Ben was at least happy to receive valuable extra bonus points for the main championship ladder, after earlier being so close to elimination.
        </p>

        <p>
            With antes and blind levels at extreme level’s, Michael’s chip count was now heading into the danger zone, and soon Brian took his remaining chips to consign him to third place. Unlucky Michael, but an excellent effort in making the top three after a solid start to the game. Maybe bring a spirits measuring cup next time :)
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes the heads-up finale of two big stacks can take a while to play out as both players desperately want the win. Brian had not won this season, and Steve was on the cusp of being the first back to back winner in the history of the square poker*, and it only took 3 hands before all the chips were in the middle. With Steve having only marginally more chips than Brian, meant that if he lost, he would effectively be out, but win the hand, and he would win the night.
        </p>

        <p>
            Brian tabled Q-J, and was then dismayed when Steve tabled K-Q. Brian was looking for Jacks on the board, but the flop offered K-3-7. With the turn card miraculously providing a Jack, there was a slight hope that Brian could win. But no good luck story was forthcoming, and Steve took out the nights game after yet another hard fought win.

            Congratulations to Steve on becoming the first player to win consecutive games at two locations* . Steve’s winning drought is definitely over, and is now turning in a torrential down pour. Can he make it 3 out of 3?
        </p>

        <p>
            So, with one event remaining, it means the championship is still alive, with Ben’s lead reduced to 5 points with Steve breathing down his neck. Brian has an outside chance of taking out first place 11 points behind the lead, but would need some extremely favourable results on the last game. The ladder would have been a completely different story if Ben had been knocked out early with this 8-10 shove, but that’s poker….and the ladder reflects the marathon, not the sprint :)
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, a massive thanks to Paul for hosting and his family who vacated the premises allowing the game to take place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another great night.
        </p>

        <p>
            *Note: Special mention to Mark V who impressively won two consecutive games at Brian’s at his first event when the format was two games per night.
