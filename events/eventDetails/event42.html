<p>With winter coming nearing its end, Mark V hosted 7 other players including a new member to the fold, his direct neighbour Maan. With some more amazing food offerings, the
crowd soon gathered, with Dave and Michael pre-loading their alchohol intake during rugby viewing, and Andy a known late starter who was also watching his beloved All Blacks smash
the Wallabies.</p>
</p>

<p>With plates cleaned and chairs moved to the poker table, everyone settled in for the nights game, with Carlos showing his intent by firing out of the blocks, taking down the first hand with
pocket deuces.</p>

<p>Andy got everyone to fold, with some large overbets, and with conversation bounding between topics, they settled for a while on TV shows, and after our host had
incorrectly referenced Narcos and Nachos, it conjured up various alternate visuals, and became a running joke for the evening.</p>

<p>Carlos was still running hotter than hot springs during a heatwave, and with good size bets holding pocket Ace's he managed to keep Maan in the hand and extricate some chips
in the process.</p>

<p>It wasn't all one way traffic though, as Jade (drinking 0% alcohol beer after drinking a brewery the night before) coaxed some of Carlos chips towards his stack after his
J-8 was good on a Jack high flop, with Carlos A-10 hitting a 10 on the turn card.</p>

<p>It's fair to say, that for the rest of the crew hitting the turps, the poison was starting to work it's magic, as Andy managed to show his straight on the turn card, with one
card still to come. With Michael still in the hand, now knowing exactly what Andy had, the river card was a brick, but Andy bet out. Of course, Michael folded, and
no doubt saved himself some chips in the process.</p>

<p>Michael fell foul of Brian's pendantic rule following when he <a href='https://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+a+string+bet+in+poker' target="_blank">string bet </a> on the flop,
but his bemusement was soon shifted after Jades words of wisdom that "marriage is based on hatred" was soon the topic of the day.<p></p>

<p>The last hand of the first hour saw a massive chip re-allocation after the board ran out A-4-2-10-7. With Andy making a set with pocket deuces, but Michael making a bigger
set with pocket 4's. Both players must have thought they were good for all the mulla, and with Michael neatly stacking all his spoils of war, Maan mentioned, he had folded
pocket 7's!</p>

<p>Into the second hour, charity chips allocated and blinds at 200/400, the first hand was another monster, with Mark holding JJ (the hooks), but Maan's suited Q8 hit a Queen high flop. Maybe Maan would
not have been in the hand with a pre-flop raise, but Mark soon got the bad news, and lost about 10K in the process.</p>

<p>Soon, it was Dave's turn to get into the action after receving pocket aces, and with only Michael coming along for the ride with K-Q, Dave gladly took down his
first pot for the night.</p>

<p>Brian had been going along steadily, winning a few average sized pots, and maybe everyone was wary of his raises, so he took down lots of pots pre-flop with no action. Carlos had also managed
to tend to his burns from his hot start to the night, but after a quiet period soon got back into the action winning another hand.</p>

<p>Although it was Maan's first night to enjoy/endure the boys night out, it was not his first night playing poker, and he showed Dave who was boss, after Dave made
a stab at a pot with a good $5K bet on the river. With Andy and Carlos jettisoning the hand quicker than Trump raising tarrifs against China, Maan re-raised putting Dave in a diffcult spot.
Dave reluctantly folded, and Maan showed his full house.</p>

<p>Into the 3rd hour, the pointy end of the table was approaching, with another set over set run out, depleting unlucky Jade's stack to perilous levels. With Jade holding pocket 6's and
calling Carlo's pre-flop raise with pocket Kings, Carlos bet out on the flop of J-3-K. Jade called, and was happy to see a six peel off on the turn card. The 9 on the
river didn't help both players, and Carlos kept his stack healthy with a 30K pot.</p>

<p>With such a small stack, Jade was soon the first casualty, with Maan flopping a straight, against Jade's Ace high.</p>

<p>Michael then hit a purple patch winning 3 out of 6 hands, but did lose with pocket aces against Mark holding pocket 5's and hitting a set on the flop.</p>

<p>Andy was also now short stacked with only one big blind worth of chips, and it was Maan again who eliminated his fellow countryman with yet another straight.</p>

<p>And the last hand before the break saw Dave knock out Mark, with both making two pair, but Dave's hand a higher version.</p>

<p>With the cash bubble upon us, Maan was now getting into the action, taking a good pot off Dave, with his Ace making a better two pair than Dave's J-3 on a A-Q-3-Q-2 board. Maan was then
fortunate enough to be dealt pocket aces and pillaged Michael's stack leaving Michael close to elimination</p>

<p>Michael couldn't hold on, and he shoved his remaining chips with 10-J. Carlos called (A-2s), and with Brian in the big blind holding 5-9, it didn't cost him much to
    see a flop. With the board running out 6-5-7-7-9, Brian made two pair (well, 3 pair, which would be great if it was valid), but Carlos made a flush, and Michael
    was sent to the rail in 5th place, leaving the remaining players, Brian, Dave, Maan and Carlos safely in the money spots.</p>

<p>Maan was still taking on the terminator role, and sent Carlos packing for the night after making yet another straight.</p>

<p>The terminator role soon changed hands though, as Brian ended Maan's great first time effort, after he shoved and took Maan's stack after his A-7 hit a 7 on the flop,
    with Maan holding pocket 5's</p>

<p>So the heads-up battle between Dave and Brian began with chips going back and forth with patient pre-flop raises, but it was long before Brian had a slight
advantage in chips, after some aggression putting the pressure on Dave. The last hand saw Brian shove his K-10 on a King high flop, and with tireness coming into
play, Dave called with A-9, hoping to overtake Brian by the river. With no ace appearing, it was Brian who took out the nights honours</p>
