    </p>

    <p>The eventual head count of 10 excited players made their way to the second poker event of the 2018 calendar and first poker outing at Michael's who was keen to impress, and impress he did. </p>

    <p>With the cold winter nights not quite upon us, pre-dinner drinks were served in the comforts of the outside seating area, as people commented on the quality of Michael's extended "dick". Players reacquainted with old foes catching up on peoples activities and deriding peoples choice of sports viewing.
        Ben was kind enough to give Simon a lift after Simon's major knee surgery and everyone got to admire the wound, with suggestions that he should dine out on a shark attack story instead.</p>

    <p>With food preparations being made all day, players were in for a treat, and Michaed secured an overwhelming top of the class certificate as he served up a meat fest that would make vegetarians cringe.</p></p>

    <p>Soon it was time for players to take their random allocated seats with Simon being granted special seating privileges so he could rest up his bionic leg that should probably avoid any strong magnets in the future.</p>

    <p>The game started with host Michael flying out of the blocks with a good early win in the first hand when his K-9 hit two pair, with Simon's A-K not enough to hold on. Simon did thought recoup some of the early losses very shortly afterwards after his pocket Jacks held.</p>

    <p>Despite suffering toothache, the stalwart player Paul was playing a more aggressive game (blame the drugs), and managed to get Steve to fold on the river after some consistent good betting.</p>

    <p>Andrew may have been taking notes on this gameplan as he also got Carlos and Paul to fold on the flop after he raised when it showed 6-5-6.</p>

    <p>Brian min raised pre-flop but got two callers, and when he bet again (continuation bet) on the flop of K-K-Q, everyone folded. Brian showed A-J, so was happy that no one had a King or Queen! Brian also started to gather more chips when his 2 pair outmatched Andy's pair of Jacks.</p>

    <p>The first real noteworthy hand was with Mark and Carlos going into battle. With the board finally running out 4-2-6-7-J Mark bet out on the river. Carlos deliberated and then called. Mark sheepishly announced "I've only go a pair of 8s", upon which Carlos comically smashed his cards on the table stating "I've only got a pair of 9's".</p>

    <p>After the cacophony of hearty guffaws had subsided, Mark and Carlos were at it again with Mark holding A-9 and Carlos A-8, on a 4-2-J-A-2 board. Mark's all in on the river gave Carlos plenty to think about, but a good call from Carlos ended up with a split pot with the Jack complementing their two pairs.</p>

    <p>It's fair to say that Mark's early attendance for the night and the alcohol consumption was starting to play a factor when Brian showed 2 pair, leaving Mark pondering where his cards had disappeared, as he couldn't recall mucking them.</p>

    <p>Dave's was sticking to a patient game plan, but keen to get into the action called Simon's big river bet, after Dave had made a straight with his J-10. Unfortunately, Simon's suited 3-4 outshone Dave's hand as he made a flush.</p>

    <p>Steve had not really found any good spots to make in-roads into the nights action, and was nursing a short stack, upon which Michael quipped "You've got more hair than chips!".</p>

    <p>Not to be deterred, Steve raised pre-flop with his pocket 9's, and Andy (pocket Queens) and Carlos suited 8-2 came along for the ride. Despite Carlos being a massive underdog pre-flop, he stayed around to get a flush, and the gambling act paid off this time.</p>

    <p>After a well deserved break and players chips replenished, the blinds recommenced at 200/400. Paul was nonchalantly peeling off $1000 bets on the flop, turn and river after his A-4 hit an ace on the flop. Michael also matched his ace with A-Q, and was vociferous in announcing "You beauty" as he scooped the engorged pot.</p>

    <p>Paul was straight back into the action with K-9 against Carlos and Mark holding K-7. With Carlos hoping to make a flush by the river, it was no match for Paul's two pair on a 9-K-6-6-5 board, so Paul recouped some of his earlier losses.</p>

    <p>With no raises pre-flop Simon got to the see the 2-J-8 flop with his J-6, going up against Paul (pocket 10's) and Michael (pocket 9's). With no 9 or 10 appearing on the turn or river, Simon was starting to accumulate chips nicely.</p>

    <p>Ben was starting to raise in good spots, but he was getting called with players holding premium hands so he was having to wait for him moment in the limelight.</p>

    <p>After raising, Brian (A-J) took a good dollop of chippage from Michael (J-7) as both hit the Jack on the flop, but Michael could not hit a 7.</p>

    <p>Andy who generally plays a straight bat at poker, knocked Brian off the hand pre-flop, after Brian's min-raise and Andy's re-raised heavily. Brian determined that maybe Andy had a strong hand and folded. With Andy's cards consigned face down in the muck, only Andy knows!</p>

    <p>Michael (A-K) and Paul (A-2) were soon squaring off on a 8-2-2-6-6 board. Michael had two pair with his Ace-kicker, but Paul had a full house. Michael tried to push Paul off the hand after raising, and then pushing the rest of his chips into the middle stating all-in. Unfortunately, this
    goes against poker etiquette and is known as a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ge5re7zRU" target="_blank">String Bet</a> so he was called back to his original raise. Whether Paul would have folded to an all-in wondering if Michael had a six, we will never know, but Paul called the original bet, so maybe it saved Michael some chips?</p>

    <p>Into the 3rd hour where every decision had more ramifications, Dave kept his stack heading in the right direction with pocket 7's taking down a good size pot augmented with the ante's</p>

    <p>The table then witnessed an emotional Ben winning his first hand of the night which indicated how much junk Ben must have been dealt.</p>

    <p>Brian was enjoying the chip lead position, but soon came unstuck against Simon. The night's first pocket Aces made their way to Simon who raised pre-flop, and Brian called with A-Q. With
    and ace on the flop, the action was only going to intensify. Simon was all in by the river, and Brian matched Simons stack to work out how much he would be left with if he called.
    Some deliberation knowing that he would still have chips left, and he made the call, much to Simon gratidude taking down a pot of around $40,000. The chip lead pendulum had swung and Simon
    smiled through the pain of his swollen leg to enjoy the moment.</p>

    <p>With the blinds relentless ascent to lofty heights, they were soon going to cause damage to players who had not gathered enough chips. And it was Andy that received the first nights round of
    applause as he came unstuck against Ben, whose patient game was now starting to pay dividends.</p>

    <p>Mark managed to survive an all-in with his remaining $17,000 with an up and down straight draw after the flop, and gleefully took Carlo's last chips as Mark made his straight on the river. Buenas noches Carlos in 9th place.</p>

    <p>In fact Mark was wishing it was a bounty tournament where a prize is given for everyone you knock out, as he eliminated both Paul and Steve to the rail in one hand as his trip 7's lulled both
    players into his trap. With Paul having more chips than Steve pre-flop, meant Steve finished in 8th with Paul in 7th.</p>

    <p>The players exiting the game were coming thicker and faster than a village idiot strapped to a rocket, and host Michael was next on the chopping block as his pair of Queens
    were no match for chip leader Simon's full house. Such was Simons lead, he even suggested it was time to start engraving his name on the end of season trophy</p>

    <p>With the cash bubble now prime for bursting, Ben knew it was time to make a stance and pushed all in with an straight draw, but was left with a paltry amount after Dave joyfully called and won with trip 7s</p>

    <p>Running out of options, Ben shoved with J-5, and Brian called with Q-6 and knocked Ben out in 5th place. Despite being so close to making the cash, Ben did kindly take on the dealer responsibility
    for the rest of the night - much appreciated</p>

    <p>As Brian, Dave, Simon and Mark were now licking their lips at the potential cash bonanza, Brian and Simon were heads up, Simon made a strong $15,000 bet, and maybe Brian still wary after
    his earlier massive loss to Simon, folded.</p>

    <p>Brian didn't have to wait long though to boost his chip count, as Mark shoved his remaining stack with pocket deuces. Brian woke up with pocket Jacks so didn't take much persuading to call. No deuce
    was forthcoming, and Mark finished in fourth, but received his cash outlay back.</p>

    <p>Simon was still the chip leader with Brian was closing in, but it was Dave that managed to change the winds direction with a massive hand against Simon. By the river Simon (K-Q) had two pair
    but Dave had made a full house. Simon peeled off a good bet, and Dave shoved all his remaining chips. Only requiring an small extra financial outlay, Simon called but received the bad news.
        This relegated Simon to last place, behind Dave taking the lead and Brian sandwiched between the two.</p>

    <p>Not long after, Simon's night was over. Despite the river card again giving him two pair, Brian had stealthily gone under the radar with the same river card gave him a straight.
        Simon was ruing calling Brians bet and missing the straight on the board, but in his defence, he had played through pain all night despite some help with various medications and frozen vegetables. </p>

    <p>As midnight came and passed, both Brian and Dave were desperate to get over the line and retire for the night, and both thought it was going to be all over when they both flopped a straight holding
    J-10. Despite the late hour and inebriation levels, both players sneakily checked the flop and turn hoping the other would bet, and by the river, Brian made a move signalling all in. Dave snapped called, and both players
    had to settle for a split pot, and get back on the bike to continue the battle.</p>

    <p>With Brian making some aggressive moves to steal a few pots, he found himself slightly ahead in chips and shoved all in with pocket fours. Dave knew the game needed to end at some point
        and was probably aware of the chip burglary taking place in the previous hands, so called with Q-6. Unfortunately for Dave, his two overcards could not make a pair, and he magnanimously accepted defeat after a well fought night. </p>

    <p>Another stellar game of cards and plenty of fun along the way. It would be remiss not to thank Michael the host for a great night, great food and hospitality. Of course, a special
    mention to Mark who once again augmented the gastronimic enjoyment by complementing the food with his traditional nachos break snack. And thanks also to Michael's family who
    so kindly vacated the property to protect the young children from growing up too fast.</p>

    <p>See you at the next event.....</p>
