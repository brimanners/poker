    </p>

    <p>
        After a 3 month hiatus from the poker table, 8 players descended upon Mark V's.
        Inspired by the winter Olympics, they were ready to don their combative spirits to commence the 2018 journey to podium finish Nirvana come November.
    </p>

    <p>As players meeted and greeted old poker foes, we witnessed Dave having his first 'real' drink and one night off Feb fast... Words were not needed as the facial expression
    conveyed the bliss of the re-acquaintance with his ol' friend Mr Alcohol.</p>

    <p>
        With Ben and Michael known late starters, Mark served up yet another amazing pre-game feast, with the chicken breasts so large and moist, you could dine out on the
        possible double entendre's. <i>(I tried to give up double entendre's once... but it was so hard :) #dadjoke).</i>
        Washed down with a side of knee replacement and Beyond Blue budget spending allocation conundrums, players were ready to hit the beize.
    </p>

    <p>"You've got to the play the first hand" came the cry, but some players still folded their hands pre-flop with the intention of playing a solid patient game.
    Steve "I always want to see the flop" did see the flop, and eventually took down the first hand when he made two pair with his J-6</p>

    <p>The night first full house didn't take long to materialise, with Mark V's pocket 8's on a 2-K-6-K-K board, meant he took down a good size early pot</p>

    <p>Not to be outdone, Steve also made a full house when his A, 2 completed the K-6-2-2-6 board. Simon who had told himself in stern words "not to be play like a jerk"
    had folded pre-flop his 4-2 "I'm not playing that crap", so was ruing his tight gameplan.</p>

    <p>Brian soon raided Mark L's stack, when his A-5 hit two pair against Mark L's A-Q, and Steve was also running hotter than a group of supermodels in an oven (weird
    visuals), as he took another decent pot off Simon when Steve made a flush by the river.</p>

    <p>Mark L's stack was starting to dwindle after making some less than optimal calls or getting called with some less than optimal raises, but down to his last $300, he shoved
    with nothing more than Queen high. Steve only had to put a few more chips in to call from the big blind position, but did not hit the board with his 10-9, so Mark
    had to wait for his brand new shiny charity chips.</p>

    <p>Not to be dismayed, Steve was straight back into the action after Simon woke up with A-J, raised pre-flop but Steve's always seeing a flop mantra paid dividends as his 8-2 offsuit
    made two pair.</p>

    <p>The visit of American Airlines (AA) made it's way to the host Mark V, but no big pre-flop raise meant that the K-K-6 flop was seen by a a few players.
    Some bets and calls soon whittled down the players to a heads-up situation between Mark and Brian. Mark couldn't shake off Brian, and by the river, Mark was
    starting to wonder if his Aces were the best hand. Checking the river, he was put into a tough spot as Brian bet out. Mark deliberated, faced some
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQX6dXuqfEs" target="_blank" >Willian Kassouff-esque</a> psychology speech play...and relunctantly folded.
    Brian mucked his hand, and resigned his cards to the history of poker unknowns.... nah...fair enough... He flopped a full house with his K-6, but don't tell Mark okay?</p>

    <p>Simon's patient new gameplan eventually saw him involved with a pot, but after raising, everyone folded, so a small serve of chips made
    it's way to Simons stack, leaving Simon shaking his head at the situation.</p>

    <p>Soon it was the battle of the Marks. On a "straighty board" (is that a thing?), Mark V bet out. Mark L shoved all in, with an
        <a href="http://pokerterms.com/up-and-down-straight-draw.html" target="_blank">up and down straight draw</a> but didn't hit
        leaving Mark L to finally receive his partial chip up.
    </p>

    <p>Into the second hour and with Ben and Michael now joining the action, Mark V wins a good hand, after a large $3K bet got everyone to fold after his A-Q hit an
    ace on the flop. His aggressive style was accumulating chips nicely, after pushing Ben off a hand with a $5K bet with blinds at 200/400.
    </p>

    <p>Getting on board the aggressive gameplay, Mark L shoved his remaining $13K after the flop, with everyone scared to find out whether he was bluffing or not.</p>


    <p>Simon was enjoying some quality man-time after his in-laws had recently returned to the UK, and Mark V asked him if he was happy with this situation. "Stupidest question ever"
    came the response, indicating to Brian that this had to go into the notes.... Noted</p>


    <p>
        Mark L had been nursing a short stack for a while, and maybe gave a clue to the strength of his hand, as he interjected with "a quick game is a good game" to fellow
        players who were in the hand but enjoying conversing instead. The fact that the action was actually up to Mark who was the dealer didn't go unnoticed.
    </p>

    <p>Steves early hot form was now starting to taper off, even after two Aces on the board matched his A-3. Unfortunately for Steve, Brian held the other Ace, but his 8
    kicker card was enough to take down the engorged pot.</p>

    <p>Ben's stack hadn't been out in the middle for while, so his patience paid off when shoved his remaining stack with A-K.
        With one unlucky customer calling, Ben happily doubled up.</p>

    <p>Dave had also been playing a tight game, but eventually won a hand, upon which Simon offered high fives in recognition of this stupendous event.</p>

    <p>With the unrelenting increases in blinds levels, card selection was becoming more difficult, but more bountiful for any winning hand.
        With this is mind, Simon raised pre-flop, and Ben's stack lent towards a fold or shove strategy. He chose the latter and sent out his remaining stack to war with
        pocket 9's. Ben was dismayed as Simon called with pocket K's. Needless to say, Ben lost the pot, but being so early on, and only been in the action for less than an hour, decided to re-buy</p>

    <p>Mark L was officially the first person out, as he pushed his remaining stack when his J hit the Jack of hearts on the flop. Unfortunately for Mark,
    Brian had the nut flush after his A-3 of hearts matched 3 hearts on the flop. To the backdrop of applause, he deciding not to re-buy,
        but took on the dealer responsibility.</p>

    <p>Ben was now using his re-bought chips well, and received the pocket rockets (AA), luring Steve into a call with his J-K, with the Aces holding.
        Steve also decided that his night was not over, so re-bought to swell the prize money</p>

    <p>The next hand saw the demise of Michael, who finished in 7th place, as his A-7 was no match for Mark V's K-8 on the KKQ flop. Michael was probably happy
    to finish up after several comments about the music playlist from both Mark V and Brian.....No pressure at the next event then when it's held at Michaels? :)
    </p>

    <p>Dave was the next player to get his chips in good, but his pocket 8's held after Ben called his shove.</p>

    <p>The end games were now starting to come thick and fast, and Steve was the next casualty going out in 6th after calling Ben's all-in with Ben holding pocket Queens</p>

    <p>Dave also survived by the skin of his teeth, after Brian's 7-9 hit the 6-3,9,2 board. Dave needed a seven on the river to complete a straight, and lo and behold, it turned up, but
    not enough chips to greatly help his cause</p>

    <p>With the cash bubble now upon the remaining players, Dave was unlucky to miss out on the cash bonanza after being sent to the rails, when he came up against Simon who had pocket Kings (again!).
        Dave consoled himself with another beer, with the depressing realisation it could be the last one until March 1st.</p>

    <p>
       Mark V had been playing a decent game, but came unstuck when his Ace hit the flop, but Simon who was now the clear chip leader made a full house by the river. Mark
        did make the cash though, and will be happy to get a deeper run after a long previous season without much success.

    <p>Ben and Brian were now up against Simon who was holding a massive lead in chips, but Ben clawed some back in his direction after his K-6 hit the flop with
    Simon holding A-6</p>

    <p>Ben then attempted to pull off the bluff of the century and shoved with 6-4o. Simon didn't have to deliberate long with
        this massive chip stack, and called with K-Q. No luck was forthcoming for the 6-4, so Simon eliminated Ben in 3rd place</p>

    <p>With Simon now in possession of more chips than the fish and chip shop owner who had just been delivered a new stock of chips for a fish and chip convention,
        Brian had a tough ask to reverse the chip count and take down the nights first place.</p>

    <p>With Ben venturing off to the little room to.... (choose one of the following)</p>

    <blockquote>
        Splash the boots. Strain the potatoes. Water the horses. Go where the big knobs hang out. Shake hands with the wife's best friend? Drain the dragon? Siphon the python? Ring the rattlesnake?
        Unbutton the mutton? Point Percy at the porcelain?
    </blockquote>

    <p>.....He missed out on the very next hand with Brian shoving after he had a flush draw on the flop. Simon though had made a pair of 4's, and with
        the call a mere drop in the ocean against his chip count, snapped called. No flush completion... not a reference to Ben... saw
    Simon take down the game for the night.</p>

    <p>
        Great game from Simon, who although frustrated during the early section of the game goes to show that patience can sometimes be the key.
    </p>

    <p>Special mention to Mark the host for putting on another great night and food (as always). And I believe the Lemon trees were left unscathed on this occasion</p>

    <p>Until the next game.....</p>
