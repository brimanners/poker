        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian </h3>

        <p>The second event of the 2016 calendar took place at Mark V's, with the host again exhibiting some top notch culinary skills and pre-loading
            the 7 players with Chicken Ã  la Mark.</p>

        <p>Simon had turned up post-op with one arm in a sling, but thankfully Andy (like a parent helping a toddler at meal times) helped out by cutting up Simon's dinner. Simon did let
            everyone know that he uses his good hand for his ablutions, so thankfully no one had to help out in that area.</p>

        <p>With Steve and Andy chosen at the two super bonus hopefuls, and Brian the bounty target (due to Ben's absence) the game itself got off to a cagey start with the first few
            hands not seeing any grandiose pots.</p>

        <p>It wasn't long before Brian started to increase the level of aggression like a toddler on red cordial after raising lots of hands pre-flop. He took a sizeable chunk of Simons chips
            after hitting a King high flush on the flop, keeping Simon in the hand before unleashing the bad news.</p>

        <p>Steve was happy to see pocket Kings in his hole cards, but with no raise pre-flop, meant Brian came along for the ride with J3.
            With a J on the flop, Steve bet, but Brian called. With nothing to help both players on the turn, Steve checked after Brian,
            but the river provided another Jack, so Brian continued his stack building.</p>

        <p>Dave was unlucky not to augment his personal wealth building chip portfolio after his two pair was beaten by a better two pair after Simon caught his second pair on the river.</p>

        <p>Junior had been quiet for the early proceedings but soon pushed Andy, Mark and Brian off a hand after the board showed 4 clubs despite
        the lost in transation moment with Junior saying he didn't know what clubs were.</p>

        <p>The nights first split pot was between Mark and Brian after Brian's 4,3 was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit_(poker)" target="_blank">counterfeited</a>
            by the river after he flopped the straight on a 5,6,7 board. With the turn and river providing a 4 and a 3 meant both players now had the straight.</p>

        <p>The biggest hand of the first hour was actually the last hand before the break, as Simon's 5,8 squared off against Brian's 5,6. With the flop offering 2,3,4 meant
            Brian had again flopped a straight. The turn now showed an Ace meaning Simon also had a straight, but Brian a higher version of the same hand.
            With the river not changing the status, Brian sneakily checked and Simon raised.
            Brian deliberately deliberated about his next action and then pushed all in. Simon called expecting at least a split pot, and thus headed into the break ready for his charity chips.</p>

        <p>Into the second hour with Brian the clear chip leader, Simon started to show a lot of aggression and recoup some of his earlier losses. Making Steve fold on the river after betting on every street and then taking a massive chunk of Dave's chips as Simon's full house (Kings full of deuces) beat Dave's full house (Tens full of deuces).</p>

        <p>Not to be left out of this poker bravado, Junior got into the act and knocked Steve off a hand after a large $5,000 bet on the river. Soon after, Brian looked at his hole cards, mucked them and
            realised he had been dealt three cards. Even his three cards were not good enough to win the hand as Junior (A,K) squared off against
            Simon (K,8) on a K, Q, J action flop. With some good sized betting, the turn was another K, and Simon shoved all in,
            and Junior snapped called. With Simon only having approximately 5% chance of hitting the 8 on the river, we all know what happened next as the
            8 turned up like the grand finale to a magicians card trick. Some profuse apologies were forthcoming, but Simon's stack was now heading into comparable levels with Brian.</p>

        <p>Despite Junior ruing his bad luck, he got "straight back on the horse", and took some of Brian's chips after his pocket 10's held against Brian's 7,9 on a 9 5 2 flop.</p>

        <p>Brian's losses were soon negated though, as his A,10 took out Steve's A,Q on a A,6,6,10,J board.</p>

        <p>Mark was then excited to see pocket Kings, but his large raise pre-flop meant that everyone folded. Maybe the bet was just a little to large
        but any pot won is better than no pot!</p>


        <p>And again the last hand before the next break saw significant action taking place as Brian received pockets 6's on a K,6,Q board.
            Mark V was holding a King and by the river Mark pushed all in with his remaining chips. Brian again had a neural workout as there
            was a potential flush on the board, but after replaying the hand decided that this was not what Mark had, and correctly called,
            thus leaving Mark to re-buy.</p>

        <p>Into the third hour and the fireworks were ignited on the first hand post-break as Brian took Mark's shiny newly received chips,
            after Mark had called Brian's two pair A8 with his single Ace pair. Without the option of a double re-buy,
            Mark gracefully accepted defeat and took on the dealing responsibility.
            Probably not the smartest move taking the host out in two hands but poker is poker!</p>

        <p>Junior was next out in 6th place after coming unstuck against Simon after Juniors stack had been eroded by the blinds.</p>


        <p>The players exiting were now coming thick and fast with Andy leaving the game in 5th place, and not winning a hand all night. Maybe next time eh!</p>

        <p>The cash bubble was upon us, and being short stacked, also meant Dave was forced to push all in, despite his hand not hitting the flop, and left the game in his favourite fourth place, and just missing out on the cash.</p>

        <p>With Simon, Brian and Steve getting quickly back into the game after a reduced third break, Simon and Brian had comparable chip stacks with Steve slightly behind. </p>

        <p>Lots of conversations about sleep studies and helpful aids led an innocent question about Simons plight
            with his one arm strapped up and if this affected his sleep. "Do you sleep with your strap on?" came the call......
            It was a while before the cacophony of laughter reduced, probably due to the visuals kicking into everyone's minds.</p>

        <p>Steve had slowly begun to claw back some chips, but was ungracefully booted from the game after he thought he was good with his 2 pair. Unfortunately for Steve, he came up against Simon's nut flush as his AK of diamonds matched the 3 diamonds by the river.</p>

        <p>So the heads up finale between Simon and Brian saw Brian go into hyper aggressive mode and was pushing all
            in on most hands. Simon was folding, so when Brian received AK, he decided to slow down to try to get some action.
            With Simon slightly ahead in chips, a reasonable bet was called, with Simon holding 7-9 which would probably be a folded hand
            against another all in. The flop though had a 7, and after Brian pushed all in, Simon called and his pair held and Simon took down the first place spot, resigning Brian to consecutive second place finishes.</p>

        <p>The ladder sees Brian moving up one place and taking out top spot on 19 points, one point ahead of Simon
            who also moved one place ahead, making way for the absent Ben to drop to third position, but only 4 points behind Simon. Dave's consistent fourth place finishing means he stays in (yep) fourth place with Steve moving up 2 places to take out 5th.</p>

        <p>Another excellent night, great fun, great food, and with special thanks to Mark and also to Karolina and Natalia for staying off site.</p>
