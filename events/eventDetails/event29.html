    </p>

    <p>7 players sauntered over to Simons to indulge in his signature vitamin enriching Paella dish.</p>

    <p>With stomachs cavities lined with healthy vitamin enriched sea food, Mark was chosen as the initial dealer, but was dismayed to realise he had misplaced his cheat sheet. After some frantic searching,
        the well worn hand chart was found, but Mark then dealt the cards out without the deck being shuffled or cut.</p>

    <p>The first couple of hands were not ones for the highlights reel, as nobody was making any good hands and the alcohol "bluff" juice had not made its way
        enough into players bloodstreams.</p>

    <p>Jade was the first recipient of a decent pot, after Brian who had made a straight to the J with his J-6 called Jades river raise after Jade had also made a
        straight, but up to the queen with his QJ.</p>

    <p>Mark started to get in the action after he semi-bluffed his flush draw on the turn card and pushed Carlos out of the hand holding a pair. Simon (J-8) and
        Steve (J-10) were soon squaring off after a Jack high flop. The betting intensified when Simon bet $1,000 on the river when it produced an 8 giving him two
        pair. Steve called and said au-revoir to his chips as he received the bad news.</p>

    <p>Soon after, Brian (AK) raised 3 times the big blind, and made everyone bar Simon (pocket 5's) fold. Despite Brian not hitting the flop, his continuation bet
        succesfully pushed Simon off the hand who was fearing his pocket 5's were behind.</p>

    <p>The pocket rockets were then procured by Jade who correctly raised pre-flop to reduce the field, and then continuation bet the flop. Unfortunately for Jade,
        both Brian and Mark missed the flop so had no choice but to fold, but any win is a good win.</p>

    <p>With blinds at 100/200, Steve got Jade to fold after a $500 bet by the turn, despite Jade having a low flush on a diamond heavy board. Steve though showed
        two pair so blissfully took down the pot whereas Jade had to lick his wounds and get ready for the next battle.</p>

    <p>The biggest hand of the night so far had Jade dealing out a 10, A, A, A, by the turn, with Carlos holding pocket 9's and Dave J,Q The betting ferocity
        intensified by the turn, with both Steve and Simon holding K's. Simon had asked Brian for some advice with Brian advocating a fold, but after a K was cast
        onto the board on the river, probably decided not to heed any of Brian's recommendations in the future. With Carlos still holding a full house but Dave
        making a straight meant Carlos bet for value, Dave called and magnanimously accepted his chip loss.</p>

    <p>Simon wasn't able to ask for advice on the next hand as he was heads-up with Brian, and after some cagey checking and betting, both turned over J-Q and split
        the pot. The last hand of the first hour had Simon and Brian squaring off again, with Simon min raising with his QQ, but Brian coming along for the ride with
        JQ of diamonds. The flop had 2 diamonds and a K, which slowed down Simon's betting and with the turn announcing the Ace of diamonds,  meant Brian now took the
        lead with the nut flush, and one off a royal flush. With a blank on the river, Simon bet $2,000, Brian re-raised to $5,000 and was happy for Simon to call,
        as he delivered Simon the less than optimal news.</p>

    <p>Into the second hour with charity chips allocated, Simon raised from the small blind position with AK, but only caused everyone to fold. </p>

    <p>Poker had various terms like bluffing, semi-bluffing, but we may have a new entry - "I thought I was bluffing". This new categorisation was exhibited by Mark who was hoping to make a flush. With the river card not completing his hand, he bet anyway.
    When everyone folded, he proudly showed his card stating he was bluffing, only for the populous to realise he actually had the best hand on the board with a straight!</p>

    <p>
      In between various Kokoda trail conversations, Simon was initiating his chip swelling manoeuvers  after raising two hands in a row and getting everyone else to fold. He then
        managed to knock Brian and Carlos off the next hand on a 2,J,10,2,7 board. Both Brian and Carlos were holding a J, and thought Simon must be betting for value
        with a deuce, but were dismayed to find out that he only had a 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jade must have been getting dealt some serious junk, as he was uncustomary folding many hands pre-flop. He did though take down the final hand of the second hour
        after Steve jettisoned from the hand after Jade raised.
    </p>

    <p>Heading towards the pointy end of the tournament in the third hour, Steve made a massive call to push Mark onto the brink, after Mark made a massive $10,000 river bet
        after missing his flush. Steve neurons must have been overheating, knowing that a call and a loss would leave him close to elimination. Enquiring about re-buying,
        with one hand on his wallet, he decided to call and joyously moved himself into the chip leader position for the night. A good try by Mark who thought it was
        time to make move, but unfortunately got caught with his "hands in the cookie jar".

    <p>Dave also made a big dent into Simons stack, after his pair of Kings by the turn overtook Simons pocket 9's.</p>

    <p>With Mark only holding 1 big blinds worth of chips, he received Ace, deuce, so knew it was time to make a move. Only Steve was left in the hand
    and after Steve matched his Queen on the turn, left Mark one card away from the wooden spoon position. With no ace appearing on the river, Mark was
    the first casualty of the night.</p>

    <p>
        With blinds snapping at the heels of the short stacks, it was Jade who chanced his luck when he received an A,7, going up against Steve with pocket 10's.
        With the flop showing A, 10, 2, Jade understandably assumed he might be in with a chance, and pushed all his remaining chips into the middle. As the players
        cards were revealed, Jade was looking down the barrel of a 6th place finish, and to rub salt into the wounds, the turn produced another 10 giving
        Steve quad 10's! Well, if you going to go out, you may as well go out to a monster! Steve was now the clear chip leader, followed by Carlos, Dave not
        far behind and Brian and Simon nursing short stacks.
    </p>

    <p>The 10's were still being Steve's BFF's and he made Simon's chip stack experience another bingle. With the board showcasing 10, 5, 5, 10, 10, Simon
    bet the community cards (10's full of 5's), but Steve called and showed pocket Jacks, and therefore having a higher full house (10's full of Jacks).</p>

    <p>Brian who had also been dealt Junk over the last hour or so, was hoping to ladder up and accumulate more points, but was forced to chance his luck
    when his chip stack dropped to two big blinds. Unfortunately for him, he was taken out in 5th place by Carlos, who also received the bounty prize as a result.</p>

    <p>With the top 3 players being paid, the bubble was upon us with Dave up against monster stacks Steve and Carlos and Simon
    hanging on. Surely, perennial fourth place finishing Dave could break the statistical anomaly. Oh, seems not, as Dave launched his remaining chips into the
    middle of the table, but could not hold on.</p>

    <p>With Steve asking how Simon was still in the game, it wasn't long before Simon's depleted chip stack was heading towards Steve, leaving Steve and
    Carlos to battle it out for the nights honours.</p>

    <p>With Brian fevereshly dealing out the hands to try to get to the end game at a reasonable hour, both Carlos and Steve were adopting careful poker
    strategies with very few raises and both players getting to the flop.</p>

    <p>The chips stacks were moving backwards and forwards with Carlos having the upper hand until Steve took on a more aggressive stance. Despite, less than
    optimal starting cards, the aggression was starting to work, as Steve won consecutive coin flips to move into the dominant chip position.</p>

    <p>The final hand saw Steve holding 2,5 offsuit take on Carlos Q-7 after the flop showed 5, K, 3. Carlos called Steve's shove, but could not find a Queen,
    and so Steve was crowned the worthy winner on the night.</p>

    <p>Congratulations to Steve whose point accumulation means he joins Ben and Brian at the top of the ladder on 21 points, but Ben still holding the
    top spot, as he has played one less game. Unlucky Carlos, but his points haul moves him upto 6th place.</p>

    <p>Lastly, a special mention to Simon who provided another great night, with top notch food offerings, and also a spention mention to Jade who
    allowed Simon's family to stay at his house to allow the event to take place.</p>


    <p>Until the next game.......</p>
