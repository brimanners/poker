        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Hank and Bob </h3>
    </p>


    <p>Hank: Welcome to the live reporting of the 5th Square poker event of the 2017 poker season. I'm Hank and I'm joined by the auspicious partner in crime Bob, who will be my wingman for the evening. Bob will be keeping all the viewers up-to-date with the action from the secondary table.</p>

    <p>After a delayed start due to fixture congestion, we find ourselves warmly welcomed to Steve's abode where we are hearing some breaking news. Yes, ladies and gentleman, we have just been informed that the number of runners has hit an incredible fourteen players. Yes, you heard that right, fourteen players have descended upon Steve's house, including three newcomers, namely Kevin, Andrew with the special guest Jacob who has been given honorary inclusion status, rather than being confined to his room for the night.</p>

    <p>Bob: This is incredible Hank. My records show that the previous record is 11 players held at Mark V's at the June event of the 2015 season. From my vantage point I can see a massive turnout all devouring pizza's and garlic bread, no doubt excited about the upcoming swollen prize pool.</p>

    <p>Hank: It seems we are getting close to the start of the battle Bob. Players are being allocated table numbers for the night games, and it looks like, we've settled on the following structure. The big table will host, Carlos, Michael, Jade, Jacob, Steve, Simon and Brian.</p>

    <p>Bob: Indeed Hank, that has left the following players on the small table: Ben, Paul, Dave, Mark V, Mark L, Andy and Kevin.</p>

    <p>Hank: The tension is palpable as players are taking their places, checking their chip stacks and settling their beverages into the cup holder. Bob... tonight you have the honour of starting the game.</p>

    <p>Bob: Gentleman... good luck tonight, play well, we want a fair game, enjoy yourselves and most importantly…. shuffle up and deal!</p>

    <p>Hank: The action has started at the big table, and it seems Jade is flying out the blocks and has taken down the first hand with pocket 10's...</p>

    <p>Bob: Unbelievable Hank... The action on the small table has also started with newcomer Andrew getting in on the action with pocket 10's, but he's unfortunate to lose to Mark V's who had trip 9's... What a start.</p>

    <p>Hank: Some very one sided action on the big table, as Jade is running hotter than the surface of the sun, as he's taken down 3 of the first four hands. Incredible stuff here.</p>

    <p>Bob: Some contentious breaking news from the small table. It seems the cards have been infiltrated by two extra Queens! Some pre-game mix-up must have led the seat allocation cards being dealt into the main pack. Six of a kind anyone? I'm glad the error was detected early on in the game Hank, as there is no precedent to how the hell they would have sorted out that mess!</p>

    <p>Hank: Breaking news from the big table. It hasn't been long into the night, and Brian has woken up with the rockets. Our spy camera's can see him holding two aces, and it looks like he's taken a dent out of Jade's stack as Jade's A-10 could not beat Brian's trip Aces when the last Ace of the desk appeared on the turn card.</p>

    <p>Bob: Both the newcomers are being very active early on … causing a lot of blushes with their constant raising and reraising.  It seems they're reminding everyone about what it was like when they all started out and before they all became bitter and twisted poker players.  Yep - Enjoy it guys, you are only new to this caper once - and it’s a great time to be alive…</p>

    <p>Hank: It seems Jade is straight back on the horse as he's ransacked Carlo's and Simon's chip stack, after making a straight against Carlos' and Simon’s two pair. In fact, news just in.... We've just learned, that Simon is out of chips. What an amazing start to the game. Simon will be very grateful that it doesn't mean the end of the night as he's been given some of his charity chips to keep him in the battle.</p>

    <p>Bob: It's seems Simon is not alone Hank. It had been quiet for a few hands, but Andrew has been dealt a blow with all chips departing for a new abode, with Paul being the beneficiary of a massive pot with his KK hand picking up another K on the flop.</p>

    <p>Hank: Another massive hand on the big table Bob. The board ran out 9, 3, 3, Q, 3. with Simon holding Q, 10 giving him a full house (3's full of Queens).  Incredibly, this was no match against Brian who was holding K, 3 giving him quads 3's! With the river completing Simon's full house but turning Brian's trips into quads we witnessed some fireworks. A sneaky check by Simon trying to lull Brian into a trap, left Brian wondering how much to bet to ensure Simon called. Some Hollywood speech play may have been unnecessary as Simon was always going to call with such as strong hand, and Simon has been left ruing his bad luck here viewers, and needs to turn around his fortunes to stay in the game!</p>

    <p>Bob: Amazing Hank... This is why our prime time poker show is such a hit with our viewers. News from the outer table, it seems Ben who hasn't been playing a lot hands but just gone heads up on a board containing three hearts and a jack high against Paul… Yes...live action here ... Ben has shoved his entire stack with absolutely nothing. Paul is deliberating .... wondering whether his pair of Jacks could be out muscled by either a straight or a flush. And then you have it....Paul has folded. and Ben has rubbed salt in the wounds by tabling his bluff. What a move. Paul is licking his wounds, but I'm sure he'll be looking for revenge at the earliest opportunity.</p>

    <p>Hank: We've been interested to see how newcomer Jacob would approach the evening. Breaking the record of being our youngest competitor by over two decades, we had heard news of him honing his skills with his friends outside of the Square poker main events, but it looks like he's using that experience to swell his chip stack. He's just coaxed some of Brian's winnings in his direction after his flush swamped Brian's pair of aces, and then hit trip 10's and took some of Michael's chips. Stella performance early on from the youngster. We've are also witnessing a relieved Steve winning his first hand of the night. In fact, it seems that is the last hand before we head towards to the first break. What a start to the game Bob...</p>

    <p>Bob: Yes, it's all over on the small table as well Hank. Mark V is smiling contently after some good wins to leave him as the chip leader and it looks like Andrew and Kevin have been enjoying themselves thus far.</p>

    <p>Hank: Before we head to an advert break, we can report that Simon has been questioning the bedroom prowess of some of our expats from over the ditch. Seems, the survey of a several hundred sheep could be subject to some further analysis.. Stay tuned for the second hour.....</p>

    <p>Hank: Welcome back viewers, we are straight back into the action here, but during the break, I did manage to review the recycling box, and can confirm, that the empty bottles are accumulating nicely. There may be some straining garbage collection trucks come bin night and with this much alcohol coursing through the veins of the players, I'm sure we're going to see more action than a Steven Seagal movie... Wow. My prediction was right Bob. Simon has hit yet another full house, but could only take a few chips from Brian who did not hang around long enough with his mediocre cards.</p>

    <p>Bob: It's been only a few hands here at the outer table, and the pendulum has been swinging for Kevin. Only a few hands ago, it was all smiles for Kevin who took a neat hand off Ben with his pair of Jacks, but unfortunately for Kev a few big losses meant that he is now out of chips! Amazing, but one moment viewers, I can report there is movement under the table...yes, I can see his wallet emerging.... he is going to re-buy back in. I think that's a sound move Hank, given it's so early into the night, and will give him a second chance to make inroads towards the big prizes.</p>

    <p>Hank: I agree Bob, plenty of time to make use of those re-bought chips. It's all action on the big table too as well. Michael's chip stack is running perilously low as he just tried to bluff Simon off the hand, with Michael holding absolutely nothing, and Simon having the straight. There was a potential flush on the board and it gave Simon some nervous deliberation, but Simon's heartbeat is returning to normal, and he's all smiles as he stacks his chips. Hang on... yes, it looks like Michael is out.. Jacob has taken his last chips, as Michael shoved with A,Q on the flop of 7, 2, 2. Jacob was always going to call with his A,2. Will Michael call it a night? Seems not viewers, he's following Kevin's game plan and has also re-bought back in.</p>

    <p>Hank: And yet more action on the big table Bob. Steve has won a massive pot after his full house got both Jacob and Michael to call with their two pair. Steve is back as a contender after a slow start.</p>

    <p>Bob: We’ve just witnessed Mark L going about his business accumulating chips - with one hand helping to wipe Mark V’s massive chip lead with a two pair with an ace against a two pair with Jacks. And it looks like Dave is all in...and wow… he’s out! Oh… it seems Dave is not wanting to call it quits quite yet, and has just rebought back in.</p>

    <p>Hank: Breaking news from the big table. Jade has just pushed Brian onto the brink when he called Brian’s A-K pre-flop raise holding A-7. What a flop from the gods with A-7-9. It looks like Brian is just pushing his paltry remaining chips into the middle and yes, he is also out. Looks like Brian is following the trend of the early finishers as has produced a shiny new note to increase the nights prize pools to levels only second to the WSOP main event in Vegas!</p>

    <p>Bob: We’re heading towards the second break now and it looks like the newcomer Andrew - with all that Snap and 21 experience - is emerging as the clear chip leader. We’ll see you the other side of the words from our sponsors for the pointy end of the tournament.</p>

    <p>Hank: Welcome back to the 3rd hour of the evening entertainment, and we can report that all 14 players are still in the game, although some players are nursing very small chip counts, with very little enticement to re-buy due to the large blind levels.</p>

    <p>Bob: Amazing tension on the small table Hank. Andrew has made Heath Poker history by being the first to call time on a player.  Whether this was based on his previous experience playing snap - who knows - but it is actually a valid option for professional poker players to use in tournaments around the world.   So it is actually a thing.  It can also be a dcik move too…</p>

    <p>Hank: Contentious stuff there Bob. Massive news here from the big table. We have our first casualty of the night. Michael got his chips in good, but could not hold on, and has gracefully received a round of applause for this efforts. I can’t believe it, it’s coming thick and fast here. Carlos has also just exited the game. That means we will need to reshuffle the tables with the small blind required for the big table. That will be Ben….</p>

    <p>Bob: Ben is going to have to wait Hank, as he’s involved in a hand. There’s a crowd watching this one as Mark L has just bet into Ben at both the flop and the turn.  On the river, Ben has just gone all in. What’s that - Mark L has just snap called and tabled two pair...Can Ben manage to beat that? Wow - he has just flipped trip threes. Massive stuff here.</p>

    <p>Bob: Looks like the next hand is also shaping up to be a whopper. Bang - We have just lost a player. Mark V has somehow managed to relinquish his chips after a good start to the game. We are now down to 11 players, which means we are on the final table bubble!</p>

    <p>Hank: Incredible Bob… Sorry what was that</p>

    <p>Bob: Welcome back yet again to the secondary table, and I can announce that we are final table ladies and gentleman. Kevin has just gone out in 11th place after a great first foray into the madness that is the square poker tournament. Good effort Kevin, and we hope we see you again at another event in the near future.

    <p>Hank: The remaining 10 players have now reallocated to the final table with the top 5 being paid. Which of the following players Ben, Brian, Steve, Paul, Simon, Mark L, Jacob, Andy L or Dave will take home the cash prizes and which players will need to explain to their families why they’ll be hungry this week.

    <p>Bob: Bang...Dave is out… incredible stuff here Hank, as Dave’s small chip stack had to try to double up, but could not get the luck he needed. At least he didn’t finish in 4th place!

    <p>Hank: It’s official, we are down to eight players. Ben has sensationally knocked out Andy L in 9th after Andy’s two pair was no match for Ben’s straight. Ben seems to be getting some nice hands at the right time of the night to swell his chip stack.

    <p>Bob: It looks like our only remaining newcomer Jacob is in trouble. He’s down to one big blind and has chanced his luck with K-2. He’s up against Simon who is dominating him with his K-Q….and the board has run out with Jacob leaving the game in a respectable 8th place.

    <p>Hank: Those blinds are really start to hurt the players Bob. Okay - we’re looking at another possible exit. Mark L has his chips in the middle….and he’s gone in 7th….goodnight Mark L after being involved in so much of the night’s action. Too late to re-buy, but it seems Mark L is taking on the dealer responsibility. What a gentleman. And that means we are on the cash bubble!

    <p>Bob: We’ve just been informed by our spy camera’s that Steve has received two aces. Surprising that he hasn’t raised pre-flop here Hank, but then again, it can sometimes work as a great trap. Brian has called with his suited cards (A-J hearts), and Mark L is flopping it out.

    <p>Hank. Was that meant to sound rude Bob

    <p>Bob: Probably...anyway, two hearts on the board Hank. Steve is betting, and unsurprisingly Brian is calling. Wow… The turn is another heart...and Steve is still betting, with Brian just calling. A brick on the river means Brian has the nut flush and this can only mean bad news for Steve. Steve has checked, Brian has bet for value and Steve has called… Massive pot headed to Brian there Hank. What a time to accumulate chips.

    <p>Hank: It’s certainly firing up Bob. Hang on, Simon in the big blind has shoved with absolutely nothing, yes, nothing. Obviously hoping to chance his luck, he got Brian to call, but Brian woke up with the ladies (which sounds like a fun thing) (QQ), and with a queen on the flop, means Simon is drawing dead. We are down to 5 players!

    <p>Bob: All the players are smiling as they’re in the money - what a feeling Hank after hours of blood, sweat and pizza.</p>

    <p>Hank: Here we go again viewers. Jade is calling Paul's bets chasing a straight. We can see that Jade has eight outs to make his straight, and unbelievable, he's got there on the river
    Wow... Jade has bet strong enough to put Paul in. What will Paul do...yes, he called, and he's been eliminated in 5th place. Great effort by Paul on his first event
    of the year, and takes home a nice monetary reward for his efforts</p>

    <p>Bob: That leaves Ben, Jade, Steve and Brian to take out the top 4 spots. Steve has never really amalagamated a massive stack all night and it looks like he's all
    in with 8, 5 after the flop included an 8. Brian's K-8 is dominating Steve, but with two cards to come, can Steve double up... Unfortunately not.. We are down
    to 3 players in the medal positions. Steve still looks reasonably happy with himself as he looks like he is wondering if his financial windfall can pay for
    a cleaner!</p>

    <p>Hank: Three left viewers. Thanks for staying up so late to watch the finale. It seemed midnight passed a long time ago, with some of the players already left
    and tucked up in their doonas. One moment...There is tension in the air. Ben signalled that he hasn't looked at his cards and has pushed all in. Brian doubted
    such a crazy move, but who knows at this hour and elevated inebriation levels. Brian has bailed from the hand but Jade is sticking around. Amazing, Ben, did have
    a hand and took down the pot, but he has admitted that he did look at his cards. This has outraged Jade. This could get nasty folks. Suggestions of collusion between Ben and Brian, and various vociferous and factless
    accusations are being dealt to the table ...Mark L is playing the peacemaker, and looks like the storm is passing, but the air is tinged with animosity </p>

    <p>Bob: Did someone really lie at a poker table Hank? Amazing stuff....This will shake the foundations of the poker world to the core...Anyway, players are settling down and concentrating on their cards.... and Brian has just taken a big chunk of Ben's chips, and with the bounty prize for knocking Ben out in the minds of Brian and Jade, might just sway their decisions </p>

    <p>Hank: Ben has his chips in the middle!! And he's out...Brian taking him out. Not sure what with, as our camera's have stopped working, and Bob and I have also
    been hitting the turps really hard, so our short term memories are very bad at the moment. I'm sure Ben will be happy with a solid 3rd place finish though, although I'm sure he would have preferred Brian to have
    been out earlier due to the ladder positions</p>


    <p>Bob: It's heads-up folks. Which one of Brian or Jade will take out the honours. Brian is upping the pressure on Jade like a lawyer at an O.J Simpson hearing...and has Jade on the ropes with
    three consectuive wins.
    </p>

    <p>Hank: Jade will not go away though viewers. What amazing action as Jade is clawing back chips with a couple of wins</p>

    <p>Bob: You can't stop Brian's pressure, as he's just pushed Jade's stack to two big blinds, which is still a crazy amount of chips, but those blinds
    keep biting</p>

    <p>Hank: And it's all over! Brian has done it, after another marathon poker session. It won't be long before the birds start their morning chorus, but it's
    handshakes all around, prize money distributed and a selfie of the final participants taken for posperity.</p>

    <p>Hank: Thanks for tuning in viewers. A massive game hosted spectacularly by Steve and Jacob, and the news is Brian has just overtaken Ben on the ladder positions with
    Steve still hanging on in 3rd place. You've been listening to Bob and myself Hank where it's been a priviledge to commentate on a great game of poker. We will
    see you at the next installment at Mark L's for our final game of the 2017 poker calendar!</p>
