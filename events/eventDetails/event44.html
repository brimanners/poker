<p><b>Part 1</b></p>
<p>Mark Vâ€™s medication is not working ... Wombatâ€™s medication is. Maan is actually a gentleman but surrounded by fcukers. Steve is batting way above his average .. much like I and Jade is just happy to eat meat / even if that meat is Riach. </p>

<p>I probably should not drink single malt.</p>

<p><b>Part 2</b></p>

<p>And to follow up... Carlos is not Argentinian ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· and makes great guacamole and Micheal and Steve had a 3-some with a goat. True ...100% </p>

<p><b>Part 3</b></p>

<p>It feels good to be alive on this fine morningâ€¦ Iâ€™m a little dusty but it seems single malt is the weirdest juice. I generally donâ€™t dream but last nightâ€¦ wowâ€¦ colourful and there were no goats. Not one. Also, I just looked at my notes from last night (below) and they are remarkably accurate â€“ I know this because I really cannot understand any of them. It is worth noting too that Steve had a 4 of-a-kind last nightâ€¦ I cannot remember what in but let the record show he did. I did enjoy the dump before hopping into the cot last night â€¦ thatâ€™s where I found time to type up the vast notes below. I need to back another one out now.</p>
