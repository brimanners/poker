    </p>

    <p>
        7 players re-entered the poker scene at the 2017 opening night at Brian's. With various pizza's on offers, players lined their stomachs ready for the ensuing battle.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a sedate start to the proceedings, Jade started off the night taking down the first hand. It wasn't too many hands later though, before the betting ferocity intensified with Ben and Andy squaring off.
        Ben raised on the river, but the new all action Andy re-raised. Ben deliberated, but called resulting in the nights first split pot after both players had made full houses.
    </p>
    <p>Junior and Ben were getting into the thick of the action accumulating chips productively with Ben swelling his chip stack after getting Jade to fold on the river after Ben's big raise.</p>
    <p>Wanting a piece of this early action, Carlos was happy for Brian to bet on the river after Brian matched his ace. Carlos' checks had lulled Brian into his trap as his Queen matched the two
    Queens on the board.

    <p>Not to be perturbed, Brian recouped some of his losses by taking some of Ben's chips as he chased down a flush by the river.</p>
    <p>Steve had been quiet thus far, but did eventually win a hand, but only a minimum serve of chips due to a lack of betting.</p>
    <p>Jade was involved in almost every hand during the early stages, and maybe his tactics were vindicated as he was successful on more than one occasion chasing a flush or straight.
        It wasn't always chocolates and roses though as his chip stack experienced some bingles along the track.
        In fact, his chip stack was like a Roller Coaster on steroids as it moved up and down with each hand, with a big dip being witnessed as he said "até logo" to his chips as they headed to Junior.</p>
    <p>After the first break with charity chips allocated, Junior versus Jade was starting to become the main attraction with both players ending up as heads-up combatants on numerous occasions with Junior just edging the
    battle count.</p>
    <p>Brian soon took a decent pot off Junior though after getting him to call his $10K bet after his pocket 10's matched a 10 on the board, with Junior having a pair of aces.</p>
    <p>As the alcohol was starting to weave it's magic, Jade offered up the nights first piece of wisdom, equating not showing your cards if you won, with pissing on someones shoes and
    not saying sorry. A tenous link at best, and a reminder not to stand next to Jade at the pubs urinal.</p>
    <p>Suprisingly, into the third hour and everyone was still in the game, but with enlarged blinds and ante's increasing the pressure, Steve's chip pile was looking forlornly at his competitors stacks
        and heading into the danger zone. </p>
    <p>Junior was enjoying annoying Andy on multiple occasions after raising on the big blind after Andy had called from the small blind with only the blind positions in the hand.
        Junior even got over the line when his Ace King didn't hit the flop, and also winning the square poker equivalent of the Copa América after taking some of
    Carlos' chips.
    </p>

        <p>Carlos did replenish his stack after Brian holding pocket 8's decided to <a href="https://www.pokernews.com/pokerterms/keep-them-honest.htm">"keep him honest"</a>
    called his $2K bet into a $30K pot with Carlos having a better two pair. </p>
    <p>The first all in on the night caused a neural workout for Brian after his three matched two threes on the flop giving him trips. Full house or straight potentials on the river
    meant the decision wasn't straight forward, and after calling was somewhat relieved to split the pot with Ben holding the other three.</p>
    <p>Steve's lowly chips didn't last much longer, so decided to re-buy, although with his wallet at home, he lent on the generosity of his poker neighbours to sub him, after
    correctly deducing an SOS text message to the wife to bring over cash was probably not the best course of action at this late hour.

    <p>
        Steve's stack now replenished and higher than some other struggling stacks, this didn't go down too well with the "vociferous one" on the table.
        It was the next entry to be pushed on the litany of complaints queue, somewhere in between people not playing enough hands and the unfairness of ante's.
    </p>
    <p>
        Into the final session, the pointy end of the tournament was soon going to sound the final siren for some players, and Carlos was forced onto the brink after
    calling another all in from Ben who was holding K-Q. Carlos' Q-10 didn't hold and he was left with less than one small blind.
    </p>

    <p>
        With Carlos in the small blind position, he was forced to play the next hand and after everyone folded, it meant it was a flip with Jade in the big blind. Both players holding Aces meant Jade was in the box seat with a slightly higher kicker card, but the river
    card decided to give Carlos a lifeline with the pot being split. More ammunition for the complaints department, which given due time will no doubt be thrown out of
    court once the legal case for rule following is presented to the jury.
    </p>

    <p>Carlos' fate was being illuminated by the close proximity of the neon exit sight, but suprisingly it was another player who pipped him to the wooden spoon finishing line.
     Brian was down to four big blinds, and pushed all in with A-J hoping he would not be up against a monster with the remaining players.
    Ben ruminated, rubbed his chin, ruminated some more and then also pushed all in. The remaining players jettisoned from the hand, and Brian was not particularly happy to see
    Ben turn over an ace and king of hearts.</p>

    <p>Brian's resigned his fate to the whims of the poker gods, the flop offered hope with a Jack meaning he took the lead. The turn produced a heart, meaning Ben was now on a flush draw,
        a straight draw and even a royal flush draw! Brian was still marginally the favourite to win the hand and with Brian even calling for the Queen of hearts to make a Royal, the river turned
    over a queen!!! okay, the queen of spades, but Ben took the pot, and resigned Brian to his first foray into the wooden spoon position.</p>

    <p>With the applause for Brian's exit still echoing around the poker arena, Carlo's stay of execution was not a generous deal, as he went out in 6th place the very next hand.</p>

    <p>After Andy's best finishing position (2nd) at the last event and with the previous winner Dave not present, Andy had the bounty target firmly placed on his head. Fearing no-one,
    he was happy to go into battle with Steve who shoved with pocket sixes. Andy's A-J needed to pair the board, and the flop from heaven provided the Ace he wanted. With
    one card to come, Steve was on a "two outer" i.e. only two sixes might remain in the deck - For the mathematical readers amongst you, that's approximately 5% or 1 chance in 20.
    Yup, no spoiler alert needed. The six appeared, the room erupted, Steve aplogised, Andy was magnanimous and Steve was back into the game with the bounty cash
    safely banked and offsetting the loan shark interest rate allocated to the re-buy transaction.</p>

    <p>And so the cash bubble was amongst us. With Brian feverishly keeping the game ticking over at a steady pace, Jade's stack was perilously low. Being forced to call with less
    than optimal cards, he exited the game and allocated the bubble boy status</p>

    <p>Ben, Steve and Junior were now probably relieved to be in the cash knowing their families could be fed for the upcoming week, with Juniors stack in a commanding position followed by
    Ben and Steve.</p>

    <p>With only three players, the massive blinds were demolishing their stacks like a wrecking ball through a derelict house and with unnerving regularity. And as such, it wasn't long that Steve was ousted from the game
        after not getting good enough cards at the right time.</p>

    <p>The heads-up finale took on a one-sided tale of aggression from Ben. With almost every hand, Junior was facing a raise or an all-in from Ben. In the space of
    a few hands, this tactic swung the chip pendulum over to Ben, and it wasn't long before all the chips were in the middle.</p>

    <p>Ben's card were marginally superior to Junior's and with no luck forthcoming, Ben took out the nights first place.</p>

    <p>Unlucky Junior, but a great game over the course of the night. Congratulations to Ben on some patient disciplined poker with the right timed aggressive moves.
        Obviously Ben heads the 2017 ladder accumulating a healthy 10 point haul for his exertions, with Junior two points behind on 8.</p>

    <p>Until the next game......</p>
