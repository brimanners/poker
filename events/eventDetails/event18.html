        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian </h3>

        <p>The 6th poker event saw 10 players venturing to a new venue at Jades. With the promise of some pre-game “English classic” food, players devoured a well cooked “Cottage Pie”. For the un-initiated (including myself), cottage pie uses beef and shepherds pie uses lamb (obvious when you think about it).</p>
        <p>With stomachs brimming with the tasty food, the game was ready to commence, but was deferred for a few minutes until the escapee dog was retrieved from somewhere on the heath.</p>

        <p>The game started with Ben flying out of the blocks raising pre-flop, on the flop and turn. Brian came along for the ride, but gave up the chase by the turn with a sense of foreboding if he were to continue.</p>

        <p>Paul then also got into the raising game, but everyone smelt some good cards in the air, so instantly folded.</p>

        <p>Soon, it was a three way fight with Carlos, Simon and Steve going into battle on a board of QQ375. Simon with Ace high, Carlos and Steve both with two pairs, as Steve’s 7 beat Carlos’ 5 to the chips.</p>

        <p>Simon was involved in a lot of hands and thought good times were ahead as he made his flush by the river. Not to be outdone, Jade called his bet with two pair, but the river card gave him the nights first full house. </p>

        <p>Mark had been playing a patient game, but eyes lit up when he surveyed Jacks in his hole cards. With 2 fours on the board and a flush potential, he was happy that no one made their hand and gratefully welcomed the chips to his pile.</p>

        <p>Before the first break, Carlos was given his chip up, as he lost his remaining balance after Brian raised with AK, and made a straight by the river.</p>

        <p>The nights first pocket rockets then turned up, with Ben showing his cards and taking a chunk of Brian’s chips whose J/10 didn’t get to see the river as Ben’s raising scared him off.</p>

        <p>Into the second hour with extra charity chips allocated, soon saw Dave hit a full house on the river. Playing his cards well, he kept Simon betting with his 9’s, but Simon eventually received the bad news with a smiling through gritted teeth response of “tricky prick”</p>

        <p>Andy had not had any decent cards to play, but found himself in a hand on the big blind with 7-3. No raises with 3 other players not hitting the board meant he won the pot. Maybe it gave Andy some confidence to be involved in more hands as he was raising good sized bets a couple of hands later, which left Paul with a dilemma by the river. Paul was holding two pair, but with a full house potential on the board, gave Paul plenty to think about. Eventually he folded, Andy mucked his cards and the answer to the “did he bluff” question was resigned to the unknown section of the history books.</p>

        <p>Mark surrendered a massive percentage of his chip stack to Simon, despite Mark hitting two pair. Mark holding pocket 9’s was betting at a level that enticed Simon to stay in, and with his flush hitting on the river, vindicated Simon's decision to stay in the hand.</p>

        <p>An interesting hand was soon to follow with the 5 community cards revealing a straight. Mark went all in, which left Steve pondering his next move. He was playing the board, but there was flush, straight and even straight flush potential, so after some deliberation, Simon folded. Mark showed his cards and he was also playing the board and won the chips accordingly.</p>

        <p>And then things turned dark….and stayed dark. Had Jade forgotten to pay the electricity bill? A glance out of the window soon provided the answers, as the whole square was pitched into a darkness not seen since the blackouts during world war 2. Tea light candles were found, mobile phone lights positioned, but it was not exactly the easiest playing conditions. Fear not, as we had the right person in the group to solve such a dilemma. Paul ventured out into the eery darkness, returning from his man cave with camping lights that were positioned in such a place that the game now took on an old style gambling hall ambience (less the cigar smoke).</p>

        <p>Steve had not been following his mantra of trying to see every flop, but did call Dave’s bets who whose AJ hit two pair by the river. Unfortunately for Steve, his last chips left him for pastures new, but being so early in the evening, delved into his home savings for another try.</p

        <p>Players without too much success were now starting to feel the blind level pain, and it wasn’t long before Mark was all-in. Fortunately for him though, Andy holding AK and even making 2 pair, was not enough when Mark made a straight, leaving him to fight another day.</p>

        <p>Ben had been quiet for a while, but soon started on a series of all-ins that were going to decide his fate. Everyone folded, but Brian with only a few chips left himself, decided to try to double up with KQc and take on Ben. Hoping Ben’s cards were not too strong, he was dismayed when Ben turned over pocket Kings, and it wasn’t long before Brian also re-bought into the game</p>

        <p>Pocket aces then paid Jade a visit, and he took a massive chunk of Carlos stack, whose pocket 9’s were not good enough.</p>

        <p>With blind levels so high, airline pilots were making emergency avoidance manoeuvres, the first casualty was Andy. To quote “I hardly saw any picture cards all night”, meant he was resigned last place. Well, things got dark earlier, but now the conversation turned dark, with a random outburst from Jade asking the question “Don’t tell me, you’ve never kissed your own arse?”. The mind boggles…..</p>

        <p>Steve was now accumulating chips nicely after re-buying earlier, with the turn and river card giving him a straight and he had obviously had a word with lady luck prior to the evening! </p>

        <p>Simon had to make a scheduled excursion from the game for dad-taxi purposes, but only missed one round of blinds, with speed limits no doubt obediently being obeyed. He returned just in time to kick Mark out of the game after Marks two pair was not as good as Simons version of the same hand as Simon two pair started with Aces</p>

        <p>Brian was now raising at every opportunity, but did not get any callers, but did take down the blinds and ante’s which were helping his stack.</p>

        <p>With Ben’s chips now heading into the danger zone, he pushed all-in again, but survived again as his A,10 held against Jades A,2. In fact, the very next hand, he went all in again on the same hand, Going up against Carlos’ 88 and Jade’s A/6. Again Ben survived this time hitting a flush.</p>

        <p>And like a gambling stuck record, he was at it again, but this time feared the worse, as his A,3 was up against Carlos A,5. With more lives than a cat, he survived yet again, but this time only with a split pot.</p>

        <p>The excitement was mounting as the remaining 8 players tried to stay in the game, but Dave was having to chance his luck with his remaining chip, as he pushed all in with A,3. Jade called, but Dave survived after two three’s revealed themselves on the board.</p

        <p>With time approaching midnight, it was time for the next player exit, and with Leicester making a great start to the England premiership, maybe Jade was happy to be knocked out, as his more patient game unfortunately did not pay dividends this time, so he ventured off to use the internet for football viewing.</p>

        <p>Not long after Carlos was down to only one ante, so Brian took his remaining chips, and Carlos the previous events winner went out in 7th.</p>

        <p>It’s been a while since Ben had all his chips in the middle, but here we were again, and you know the outcome. He survived again taking a good chunk of Simons chips as a result. With lots of players on comparable chip stacks, it must have been all in season, and not do be outdone, Paul and Dave followed Ben’s lead and both survived all ins.</p>

        <p>Simon was next shown the exit door taking out the 6th spot, meaning the cash bubble was amongst the remaining players.</p>

        <p>Dave was now on the button, and again pushed all-in. With two pair by the turn, only 3 cards were going to knock him out. Yes, you’re there already, Dave dealt himself the killer blow, and so the bounty rolls on. Unlucky Dave….poker can be cruel mistress.</p>

        <p>With the four remaining players (Ben, Brian, Paul and Steve), now guaranteed to take home some cash, Steve and Paul were slightly ahead in chips.</p>

        <p>Brian chanced his luck with A,5, but was called by Paul, whose pocket pairs held, so Brian was resigned to 4th place. Steve then took a massive pot from Ben, and one hand later, finished the job, taking Ben out in the 3rd, and facing Paul for the nights honours.</p>

        <p>Steve decision to re-buy was now paying dividends. I won’t mention Simons quote about re-buys, but let’s just say it involves less than complementary thoughts about ones sister. Steve, whose history shows him lots of cashes, but never advancing past third place, was in unchartered territory, but had a lead over Paul in terms of chips.</p>

        <p>With a few hands of tentative betting and folding, it wasn’t long before Steve was the dominant chip holder. Paul had to try to double up, and pushed his chips into the middle. Steve called, the crowds pupils dilated with excitement…..and Steve won!</p>

        <p>Congratulations to Steve for finally breaking the winning drought. A worthy winner on the night, but also congratulations to Paul on getting so close to his second win. </p>

        <p>With only two events left for the 2015 calendar, Ben’s 3rd place finish means he extends his lead at the top of the ladder to 14 points. Steve’s stellar performance sees him leapfrog 3 places into second, 3 points ahead of Brian in 3rd, with Simon one point behind Brian. Paul’s 2nd place finish means he is only one point behind Simon, so it looks like an interesting race for the silver and bronze positions.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Jade for being a great host and to his family for vacating the property for the night.</p>
