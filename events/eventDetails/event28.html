    </p>


    <p>The second exciting instalment of the Augusta Square Poker tour took place at Mark V's on a balmy late Autumn evening. With 9 runners anxious to take out the engorged prize pool and copious amounts of points for the championship ladder, players settled their nerves with some pre-game cuisine that highlighted the hosts quality cooking skills.</p>

    <p>The game was slightly behind schedule as players waited on a weight depleted Andy to finish his second helping on his new anti-carbohydrate diet. Michael was chosen as the initial dealer, and even before our friend Mr Alcohol had made his presence known he started the process by only dealing to 8 of the 9 players in the first hand, and then enquiring about missing chips, although they were right in front of him as he had called the blinds.</p>

    <p>Jade took the first hand down with a straight completed by the river, and Brian pulling in all the chips on the next hand as his AK beat Steve's A6 on a KK6 flop. Jade was running hotter than a bare foot on a summer beach, and won another hand after chasing down another straight by the river.</p>

    <p>The pocket Aces then materialised, paying a visit to Simon, but unfortunately for Simon, everyone folded apart from Dave in the big blind whose pair of 9's did not give him much hope on a picture card heavy flop.</p>

    <p>The next decent pot went to Steve who called Ben's AK pre-flop raise after Steve happily viewed pocket Jacks in his hole cards. Simon also came along for the ride with his K-10, but with all low cards on the flop and subsequent turn and river, Steve started his financial accumulation phase.</p>

    <p>Jade was involved with most hands, and was up against Mark who was holding pocket Queens. A large $2,000 bet on the river with blinds at $75/$150 meant Jade had no choice but to fold after missing his flush.</p>

    <p>Steve and Brian were (Augusta) squaring off again, but this time the result was a split pot after both making a straight.</p>

    <p>Michael was still having dealing issues, or were they counting issues, as he now dealt for 10 player, but Jade wasn't worried, as he chased yet another straight and got there by the river after calling decent bets.</p>

    <p>Simon's luck had abandoned him, and he received his partial chip up before the 1st break, as Jade's 2 pair beat him on a flushy straighty board (are they even words?). In fact, Brian would have won the hand had he not folded to the river bets as his 8-4o in the big blind gave him trips by the river, but with so many stronger hands possible,  assumed (incorrectly) that he was way behind the other players.</p>

    <p>The first break received an extra spectator, as Mark L has decided to view the nights action from a spectator perspective, or more likely just needing a break from his teenage daughters home birthday party.</p>

    <p>Into the second hour, Ben started to get more involved and took out a large pot against Mark, after flopping the nut flush (The flop poker players dream of). With the betting level enticing Mark to stay in the pot, meant by the river, Mark called Ben's bet and duly received the bad news.</p>

    <p>Jade was still playing most hands, and received the ducks (pocket deuces), and called Ben's pre-flop raise after Ben received yet again AK. On an A, A, 4 flop, Jade was way behind, but called Ben's bets, assuming Ben was running a bluff. With the turn and river offering a 3 and 9, Ben bet large. Jade called and was ceremoniously eliminated from the nights game. Deciding not to re-buy, offering a few choice words about players not playing enough hands, he decided to stick around and enjoy a few beers as a spectator.</p>

    <p>Mark (4, 4) and Simon (A,2) were now heads-up, and Simon made a play to steal the pot on the river after betting with nothing more than his Ace high. Mark's bluff radar was set at a high level of sensitivity, and he correctly called despite multiple over cards on the board to his 4's</p>

    <p>Mark also took out another decent pot after his K,8 was up against Steve's K,Q.  With a King on the board, Mark's ferocious large river bet left Steve scratching his chin on his next move. Unfortunately for him, his fold meant he missed out on a split pot, but maybe he had read Mark's raise as being stronger than it was and was happy to protect his chip stack.</p>

    <p>Despite his protective moves, Steve's chip's were starting to diminish quicker than Usain Bolt, running downhill, on steroids, with a tail wind after Dave had his moment in the sun, and took down a $15,000 pot after making a full house, with Steve holding trips.</p>

    <p>Mark was also enlarging his chip stack after his pocket 2's held and no other playing matching the board. Andy who has been very quiet up to this point started to get involved after his pocket Kings hit the K, 6, 6 flop and moved himself towards the chip leader position.</p>

    <p>Simon's whose only success for the night so far had been a small pot with his pocket Aces was nursing a paltry chip count. Hoping to double up, he pushed all-in when he paired his deuce on the flop, leaving Ben to call his raise, with Ben hoping to make a straight or matching his two over cards. Fortunately for Simon, he survived, but was still in a perilous state.</p>

    <p>It was host Mark that was the next casualty though with Ben holding QQ, Simon A,5 and Mark 4,5. Ben's queens were not looking so comfortable by the river when the board ran out 6, 5, A, A, 7 with Simon betting on the river, Ben reluctantly but correctly folding, but Mark called, and Simons full house deriding Mark's two pairs and sending Mark to the rail in 8th place.</p>

    <p>Dave was next up to swell his chip count after his pocket Jacks were looking good on a J, 9, 3 board. With Brian holding A,9, and with a good sized river bet, Brian jettisoned from the hand correctly assuming that he was not good enough to take down the pot.</p>

    <p>Lots of good starting hands were being dealt, with Michael's QQ taking down a reasonable pot after he got both Brian and Ben to fold. Again, Brian and Dave were battling out, but another strong turn bet with Dave holding trips left Brian waiting for more fortuitous outcomes.</p>

    <p>With blind levels increasing to levels higher than ....hmm...things that are really high (it's getting late) ;) , Michael was the next victim and Simon's straight ended Michael's night in 7th place.</p>

    <p>Credit where credits due though, as Michael took on the dealing responsiblity from there on in, until the last hand - Thanks Michael</p>

    <p>The nights second arrival of pocket Aces took a vacation to Ben, but with no raise pre-flop, he was playing with fire, hoping to create a trap.  Subsequently with Dave in the big blind, his 9-10 was able to see the flop of 10, 6, 10. With 2 blanks on the turn and river meant Dave took a good portion of Ben's stack whose bets were not enough to make Dave fold.</p>

    <p>It was only a matter of time before the next player was sent to the rail, with Brian having the honour of taking Simon's last chips, when Brian's A, J held against Simons K,8 on a flop of A,K,3. With both players holding small chip counts, the inevitable all in's left Brian in a happier place, eliminating Simon in 6th place and leaving the remaining 5 players on the cash bubble.</p>

    <p>Andy, who was still playing tighter than his jeans pre-diet, woke up with the night's third appearance of pocket aces, and eliminated bubble boy Steve from the game in 5th place despite Steve's J, 7 hitting a Jack on the flop. It was at this point that Andy took on the chip leader position as he won another good sized pot after his Q,10 dominated Simon's pocket 9's on a Q, Q, 7 flop.</p>

    <p>With all players now guaranteed to be financially compensated for their nights investment, Andy's chip lead position was under threat from Ben, as Ben recouped some of his previous losses, and in the space of a few hands, was slightly ahead of Andy for the chip leader position.</p>

    <p>More blind increases left Brian's two big blind chip count saling close to the wind and left with no choice but to push all in with A, K. With only Andy calling and losing, Brian was grateful to survive and doubled up his chip count.</p>

    <p>Andy wasn't being shy in becoming involved with the the more important and tempting larger pot sizes and used his chips effectively after receiving pocket aces for his second time of the night and going into battle against Ben's A, J. With the final ace appearing on the flop, Andy shoved all-in, and Ben called. Andy had pushed Ben onto the elimination ropes, with Andy now holding a large majority of the nights chips.</p>

    <p>Ben's fate was almost sealed, so he shoved in his 3 big blinds worth of chips on the next hand without even looking at his cards, but survived after making a flush with four cards of the same suit on the board.</p>

    <p>In an almost identical board run out the next hand, Dave had slightly less chips that Brian and called Brian's all-in (A, Q) with his pocket sixes . Again, Dave was ahead until the river provided 4 cards of the same suit and matching Brian's Ace. Brian received the luck he needed at the right time and left Dave ruing his bad luck and finishing in 4th place - hmmm - that sounds familiar!</p>

    <p>The final 3 players were now hoping to make the final push towards glory, with Andy ahead in chips, followed by Brian with Ben hanging in.</p>

    <p>With the bounty prize of whoever could eliminate Ben causing Andy and Brian to rub there hands with expectant glee, it was Brian who sealed Ben's fate, as Ben didn't have much choice with less than optimal  starting cards that didn't hold, and eliminated in 3rd place.

    <p>The finale heads-up between Brian and Andy looking for his first ever win was a cagey event, with chips moving backwards and forwards between the players. Brian clawed back some chips to take a slight advantage, but the pendulum swung the other way when Andy's K-6 matched a K on the flop with Brian raising with A-3.  The biggest chips movement took place shortly after though, as Brian pushed all-in with pocket K's which held and moved him into a commanding lead.</p>

    <p>It wasn't long before Andy chanced his luck and pushed his remaining chips into the middle, but no luck was forthcoming and Brian took down the nights honours.</p>

    <p>Unlucky Andy, but a great effort in running so deep in the tournament, helped no doubt by the pocket rockets coming to visit. Andy's recent form is highlighting an upward trajectory, so maybe a win isn't far away!</p>

    <p>Lastly, thanks to Mark V for hosting yet another great night, coupled with the obligatory laughs and inappropriate conversations, and topped off with high quality food offerings.</p>

    <p>Until the next game.......</p>
