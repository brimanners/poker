        <p>Ben inhales 4 and Andy is having a tug with a blow up doll</p>
        <p>Leopold takes Brian with a straight</p>
        <p>Brian slaps back with a great hand immediately …. Then stares at Leopold with ‘back in your box bitch’ eyes.</p>
        <p>"Somebody's got a straight" says Paul ….. Well done Einstein with 6,7,8,9 on the table</p>
        <p>…and I sitting next to Dave and he’s playing with his old fella. Mark thinks he might have a rash down there.</p>
        <p>Ben puts Paul’s cock on the line … not physically, because that would be weird – no, Ben talks brave on Paul’s cards after Ben had folded… Brian drops some VLine gold</p>
        <p>For the second time in twenty minutes … Brian kills it and takes Dave out. Mark and Dave are both bruised by Brian’s cool play.</p>
        <p>Jade plays smart but then Brian cleans up for the third time….</p>
        <p>Dave and I are out… Dave’s a good bloke.</p>
        <p>Jade’s a good bloke</p>
        <p>Leopold wins a token amount</p>

        <p>Andy offered to go home due to my lewd comments. But R’Andy doll stays and none of the lewdness eventuates.</p>
        <p>Guest commentator … Dave … “Mark, you were fcuked over by a pair of 3’s”</p>
        <p>Jade bangs Brian with a straight… what happened to Jade over the time I’ve been away … he’s become sensible.</p>
        <p>Jade’s a good bloke – gave me two thumbs up … for whooping Ben’s clacker with a flush. Ben ‘rainman, cardcounter’ …</p>
        <p>Paul remembers he’s playing …”oh, I thought I folded!”</p>
        <p>Rainman bluff’s Jade …or not</p>
        <p>Rainman … stuffs mark with an all in … Mark buys back in to stay awake.. OASIS plays on the Bose --- life is good ….</p>
        <p>R'Andy Doll is getting a little pissed – complaining of a Ben and Brian show and Jade has returned to form.. .”It’s not farcken roooight that!’</p>
        <p>Various drinks are kicking in everywhere … Marriot and I self-medicate to get through</p>
        <p>….Dave declares himself as a bogan. … The table then ask R’Andy doll ”What do you reckon Andy” …”I reckon Ben’s a fucken arsehole…” this was followed by many a fcuk, fcuk …. Yeah, yeah ‘get fcuked’ was rainman’s come back sits motionlessly and wine the next hand.</p>
        <p>Jade got bored …. Went all in and Leopold reluctantly kicked his sorry arse into next week. Bye bye Jade …. 7th.</p>

        <p>Lots of shaking heads as we enter a boring part of the night ….</p>
        <p>Paul stuns the table …not sure how or why … I little too pissed to determine the reason why … “Animals” plays on the Bose.</p>
        <p>Paul… goes out a 6th with Ben flipping a ten into the river, stream or rivulet or whatever the fcuk luck is called.</p>

        <p>Brian thinks I might actually know what I am doing when I look into his eyes before he’s even looking into his cards …. I smile …all I was trying to figure out was ‘Is it your shot or mine’….
        Tap, tap ….time passes</p>
        <p>Bang … Brian plays brilliant hand on quad queens … I did not have a good enough hand to fall for thr trickery but I would have if I had but then again … if my aunt had ball’s she’d be my uncle. If, fcuken if…
