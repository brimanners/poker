    </p>


    <p>Herein there will be some discussion about poker -  not much - but some.</p>

    <p>First ... I've woken up to a huntsman spider in my bedroom... not ideal!!</p>

    <p>But....that's not the worst - let me give you not ideal!</p>

    <p>Last night, about 5 hrs ago actually, after the ferals had departed - Brian helped me bring reasonably heavy dining table back into the family room - I then cleaned up; it's just a thing I have, I prefer to wake up to a clean house...anyway I digress.</p>

    <p>It was around 1am when I tootled up to the cot and fcukme .... aaaargh ...</p>

    <p>Somehow the toilet had been leaking ... not shit-water - inflow - and a few ml of water covered the entire ensuite and a metre or two of the carpet. You are f'ing kidding me - WTF.</p>

    <p>So after towelling, mopping, cursing ... I hit the cot about 2am. Sh!thouse end to quite a fun night.</p>

    <p>Now - I am going to start at the end because starting at the start would seem too logical and in truth because I started imbibing quite early yesterday ... my notes got really scarce towards the end.</p>

    <p>In the end, the two kings were fighting Ben and Brian - to their poker death - not just for the night but for the 2017 crown. Actually that's wrong I think. Ben was close but he left with a sore back after he lost - earlier; I only remember that because I thought it was reasonably soft. so... let's start again.</p>

    <p>In the end, Brian was toying with either David or Steve for the night's win after Brian had kicked Ben's clacker and Ben left, tailed between his legs and some excuse about a sore back. Before we have any law suits - I don't think Ben lifted my heavy table so it must the injury must have occurred when he carried Catherine' rather wonderful Xmas cake to the poker night. Now back to Brian toying... I've had to be careful here because Brian toying gets remarkably close to a secret club that happens with Russians on Level 2 at Sthland... hmmm... that whole discussion was weird. Anyway ...</p>

    <p>In the end , I am pretty sure Brian beat David and took home all the chocolates. Which is a shame for David because he is currently paying off a $900 bird; feathered not Russian - and the $21.18 cents received for winning would have helped. Yeah, true -that's not fake news - Dave, the otherwise sensible if reasonably feral lawyer  laid-out $900 for a bird and a cage.</p>

    <p>As Brian Taylor would say Wow Wee!  Talking of BT - back to the commentary. Again working backwards...</p>

    <p>For those that weren't there - a few nicknames might be noted below - here's a quick reminder of some new names (Andrew not Freese - AKA - Psycho or Peanut - whatever floats your boat); (Carlos - AKA - DJ, DJ Wizard, the Wiz) (Paul - CC and dry - this new nickname was declared at precisely 9.38pm - I remember the big stuff!); and finally (Ben - C)</p>

    <p>At around 11.15 - business started to heat up but honesty I cannot read my notes ... I have written Ben the C - bail; weak as p!ss but I don't know why and Dave did really well  because he knocked out CC & dry.</p>

    <p>This was after an amazing hand at around 11.00pm - when Ben won with a house full of kings beating Paul's house full of jacks!!!</p>

    <p>And before that David knocked Carlos and Junior into 2018 - knocking them both out in one hand. I should remember the hand but by that stage I was taking music requests and Poker was getting in the way.</p>

    <p>Between 10.00 and 10.34 - Fcukall happened so Dave and I talked sh!t to fill the void.</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td><img class="border align-right slide-in" src="../images/20171126_a.png" alt="" style="float:right;"></td>

    <p>Because these notes are working in reverse - my notes become clearer but I don't really want to write them in this email - as I'll be blocked by most email screens - here's a clue</p>

    <p>Psycho Andrew (not Freese) - went all nuts - $15k opening bets very hand ... Brian went all in and good night Psycho. We found out soon after his 'episode' that he'd had just come for the food and needed to get to a 40th at Half Moon - well played I say!</p>

    <p>In the meantime, Paul on the back of the recent marriage equality vote, Paul came out in favour of women's genitalia - weird but true.</p>

    <p>Prior to that - Psycho and Ben went all in - someone won. I think Ben.</p>

    <p>Soon before that, I stuffed up a deal twice (sorry Junior) and the Ben 'did a china' copying something that I cannot remember.</p>

    <p>Very early on in the night - Brian fisted me with a flush.</p>

    <p>And we started off with some reasonable food.</p>

    <p>Bang.</p>

    <p>Interpret above if you will. Apologies  was tired and emotional early - so it was tricky to take notes.</p>

    <p>Suffice to say - all hail the King; King Brian 2017. Well done.</p>
