<p>24 hours before Covid-19 rules flexed their muscles again limiting 5 guests, we managed to get a game in at Mark V's</p>
<p>Thankfully, the chicken was put back to complete the cooking so we didn't have a salmonella outbreak..but the wait was
worth it, with another sumptuous serving setting up the nights game.</p>
<p>11 players over 2 tables. Andrew handing out chip gifts like it was Christmas, but Simon missing out on the feeding frenzy. Carlos
was running hot though seeing through Andrew's plays and when Andrew was out, everyone moved to the 10 seater.</p>
<p>Stuff happened, but as people dropped out of the game, Dave headed back to familiar territory ending in 4th, Brian in 3rd
and Carlos and Ben fighting it out for the top spot.</p>
<p>And Ben was the winner after some strong plays towards at the end of game.</p>
<p>Ben's form sees him sitting nicely at the top of the ladder with a healthy 12 point buffer to Dave in 2nd, with Michael dropping
from top spot, but in joint third place with Carlos in 3rd</p>
<p>Special thanks to Mark V for hosting another fun night. Not sure when/if the next games will happen. Let's all hope this
unprecedented situation we find ourselves in allows us to continue later in year</p>
<p>Stay safe folks!</p>
