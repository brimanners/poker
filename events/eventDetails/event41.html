<p>With Carlos still holding the table from the previous eventr, it makes sense to start the commentary for thanking him (and his son) for taking over the table to Simon's prior the game.</p>

<p>With the table all set-up, 8 players sauntered over to Simon's for the 3rd instalment of the 2019 poker calendar, with several players turning up early for some pre-game drinks and chats.</p>

<p>With what can only be described as one of the finest food offerings given to the ravenous poker crew, players were sated and ready to gather around the baize for the nights action.</p>

<p>The first hand saw Carlos jettison from the hand after Jades river bet suggested he had a strong hand. Maybe the reflective Vegas cards were playing with peoples eyesights, as there was a tame start to the game with only small pots being won.</p>

<p>It wasn't until the second level that the nights first big pot was witnessed with Jade's trip Queens beating Mark to the winnings after Mark missed his flush draw.</p>

<p>Jade was involved in a lot of the early action, but his attire became the subject of derision with Simon suggested he was a cowboy who likes the company of men...well, love is love!</p>

<p>Into the second hour, there were some statistical anomalies being witnessed with the board running out four of the same suit on numerous occasions, with Carlos being the lucky recipient of a good pot after his Queen completed the flush taking out Dave also with a flush, and Jade with pocket Aces!</p>

<p>Ben had been playing a tight game, but did eventually win a hand after betting on the flop, and everyone folding.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long into the night that Dave got all his remaining chips into the middle with pocket queens then got busted by Carlos, who made another flush on the river. Being so early, Dave was never going to to call it quits for the night, re-bought into the game.</p>

<p>People were wondering if there was some kind of magic pack of cards being used, after Ben took down a pot, after yet another four card flush board….Well, Vegas is magical!</p>

<p>Into the third hour, Mark was getting short stacked, and after hitting top pair on the flop, bet his remaining chips, but with Steve and Carlos calling, Steve took down the pot and eliminated Mark in 8th.</p>

<p>Steve also helped his cause, by taking another good serve of chips, after his two pair beat Simon to the goodies, after the Simon missed his flush and straight draw on the river.</p>

<p>It was Brian's turn to take on the mantle of news deliver all things bad, as he eliminated Carlos in 7th place, after Brian raised pre-flop with AK, and Carlos hoped for the best with his suited 64.</p>

<p>Brian then started to turn the screw as he got to see a flop, after Simon decided not to raise pre-flop with the rockets (A-A), after Brian made a flush by the river, and scooped a good prize as a result.</p>

<p>Simon couldn't believe his luck as he received the pocket rockets yet again, and with Ben shoving all in with an up and down straight draw, Simon called, and the rockets held this time, eliminating Ben in 6th.</p>

<p>With the cash bubble thrust upon the remaining players (Simon, Dave, Steve, Jade and Brian), it was time for some serious deliberations on every move. Steve thought his pocket 9's might be good on a low board, and bet on every street, with Simon staying in the hand with pocket J's (the hooks). With an ace appearing on the turn, keeping the betting low, still saw Simon take down the pot, leaving Steve in a perilous position.</p>

<p>Steve didn't have much of a choice and went all in with Q-5. Unfortunately for him, he came up against Dave holding pocket aces and Brian pocket jacks. With an ace on the flop, Brian soon jettisoned from the hand after Dave bet, with Steve receiving the bad news and being eliminated in 5th and allocated bubble boy status.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before cowboy Jade was shown the exit door after his pocket 3's lost to Simon who had made a straight on the flop, but Jade did at least make a $1 profit from his buy-in.</p>

<p>It was then the turn of lady luck to shine on Brian, after he shoved his A-7 on an ace high flop, but was dismayed as Simon called and turned over A-9! And of course, the river produced a 7, much to the dismay of Simon.</p>

<p>Dave then survived with pocket 4's against Brian's A-4, with an ace on the turn and a 4 on the river! But alas, Dave's luck ran out when his J-8 could not hold against Brian's AQs</p>


<p>And so, then heads up battle between Simon and Brian commenced. This was Simons 4th heads up battle in his last 5 outings, and all against Brian, with Simon leading 2-1 in results.</p>

<p>With Simon holding the chip lead, he needed one good knockout blow, but the chips were moving backwards and forwards with Brian increasing the pressure with any two good cards.</p>

<p>The final hand played out with Simon just behind in chips, happily seeing the 5-5-3 flop with Q-3. Simon shoved, but this was just music to Brian's ears, as his 10-5 has made trips. With the board running out with no help for Simon, it was Brian who took out the nights honours, and levelling the heads-up battle to 2-2.</p>

<p>What a great night (well, for some). Special thanks to Simon for hosting yet another superb night with some seriously good food offerings.</p>

<p>See you on the felt at Mark V's!!</p>
