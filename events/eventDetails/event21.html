        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Ben </h3>

        <p>
            Eight runners progressively rocked up to Ben's to kick off Season 4 - many still with sore heads due to an
            impromptu park night
            session the night before. For dinner, slow cooked pork sliders were served (courtesy of Mrs I) - with
            players well rested, well
            fed & well hydrated before the scheduled 7pm start time. Steve, last year's champion brought along the newly
            engraved trophy for
            all to see; and with Junior being a non-starter - the newly introduced bounty was placed firmly on this
            head. Dave was selected as
            the super bonus guy.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Session 1</b>
            <div>
                First hand of the night saw Steve take down Simon - in what looked like an ominous sign of him carrying over
                his good form
                from the previous year. Jade also got a decent hand in early - "Everyone's playing catch-up" was the cry.
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Michael arrived late with what some were describing as the Never Ending Burger - and within five minutes was
            into the host about
            the choice of music (it was "pandora's" choice) and generally whatever else came to mind but was overall was
            in pretty good spirits.
        </p>

        <p>
            About 1/2 hour in - the first big hand took place with Steve's three of a kind 9s taking down Andy's Q8 two
            pair.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, in what was thought to be a world record at 7:45, Andy went all in but outlasted Michael's pair of
            threes with a
            full house (by the way, Leopold holds the record - second hand of the night).
        </p>

        <p>
            Soon after, Michael - now down on chips early - got his K3 good on the river against Ben's Queens.
        </p>

        <p>
            The break was looming large - but this didn't stop the first crazy hand of the night taking place.
            Five players were in on the action with a 10 Jack Ace flop. A five minute delay regarding an enquiry about
            the
            size of the chip ups at the break lead Ben deciding to go all in with his two pair Jacks and 10s. To his
            dismay -
            he was called and was actually drawing dead - Michael (JJ) and Jade (A 10) both had him covered.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Session 2</b>
            <div>After play re-commenced, several hands saw chips flying back and forth.</div>
        </p>

        <p>
            Enthusiastic golf related conversation between Steve and Michael overshadowed Simon's $4k win
            against Brian - and this was duly pointed out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Andy's bad luck continued with Simon hitting a 3 of a kind against a two pair - with a $10k bet on the river being called.
        </p>
        <p>
            First split pot of the night then occurred with Jade and Brian both having a full house.
            Jade's big bet on the river was not enough to convince Brian that he was holding four of kind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dave - again quiet early but with rumours of a new game plan up his sleeve - took a big hand off Jade - getting his flush in on the flop against Jade's three of a kind kings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jade's luck finally showed signs of turning around with a large win putting him back in the game.
            After a 10 10 2 flop, Jade shoved with a full house (whilst also mentioning something about being "quite excited"),
            only to be called by Steve who was holding the other ten.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The end</b>
            <div>At this stage Dave was now holding the chip lead - quietly accumulating chips but with his eye's now firmly on the super bonus.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            A few minutes in - Jade became the night's first casualty - in a massive three way pot that had Andy also going all in with Simon.
            With KAKQK on the board - it was only going to end in tears for someone - and sure enough Andy and Simon phantomed their way to a
            full house both holding an Ace against Jade's pair of fours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Twenty minutes later - Ben went all in - with two pair on the river (9 10) - with Simon calling with exactly the same hand - meaning another split pot.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the blinds progressively increasingly  - players were looking more and more for opportunities to go all in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Steve - who had been having a quiet patch - started getting really active... lots of things happened in the space of twenty minutes like:
            <ul>
                <li>Calling a massive stone cold bluff by Dave to win a large pot</li>
                <li>Partaking in a weird father son role play conversation with Michael</li>
                <li>Stunning the table by showing his cards to Andy whilst HE was still in the hand (he hadn't just grown some Leopold size balls over the summer - he actually didn't realise that Andy was still playing)</li>
                <li>Finally being taken out in seventh place by Simon - and along with that the $16 bounty.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="col-lg-4" style="float:right;">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><img class="border" src="../images/20160206_a.jpg" alt="" style="float:right;"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="font-size:8pt; align: center;"><span style="padding-left: 30px;">..........Host and winner Ben relaxes with a post match wine............
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>
            Soon after - Michael was out - his A4 not able to hold up against Brian's 7s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Minutes later - two more were out - with Brian again taking out Andy and Dave - with trip 6s.   It was about this time that Brian - who had been quiet for a while - assumed chip leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
            Three were left - Brian, Ben and Simon - but not for long as Brian again drew from his inner Lee Harvey Oswald (OK - I know that was a lame gag) to take Simon out getting his 5s good against AK.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was now down to just Ben and Brian.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage it was 11:32pm - we were another 25 minutes away from finding an eventual winner - it was therefore no surprise that the enthralling battle of bullshit, lies and bad cards was viewed only by Steve in his role as the dealer - everyone else had had enough.
            Special mention must go to him for sticking around.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, lots of folding, lots of all-ins and a few calls lead to Ben eventually calling his K8 against Brian's all-in K7.  Luckily for him - it got through making him the season's first winner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again - a great night had by all...
        </p>
