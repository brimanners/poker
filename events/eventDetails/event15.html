        <p>So as 8 players descended upon Juniors for a new venue and traditional Brazilian fare, I thought I'd scour the internet for all things Brazilian...Very interesting results and definitely NSFW if you follow suit. Mental note to remove browsing history.</p>

        <p>Jade was the first door bell ringer and was no doubt out of breath after he lugged over his alcohol provisions for the night. After staking his claim with about 75% of the fridge real-estate, other players turned up and enjoyed greetings and general chat whilst I set up the table. The black beans and rice dish was simmering nicely and ready to be served, and many thanks going to ..... hang on....I did read about some Brazilian custom:</p>

            <p style="padding-left:100px;">"Women are generally expected to take care of all household chores."</p>

        <p>So thanks to Vivian....and what a feast it was....in fact, Ben was professing undying love to its gastric qualities "Best food I've ever had".</p>

        <p>The game was about to start, but whether another tradition or just an excuse to get drunk, everyone was "encouraged" to have a
            shot of their choice of Brazilian fire water. No-one had any idea what they were, but we were sure one was
            bought at Bunnings to help remove paint. With the host being chosen as the "Super Bonus" the game got off a slow
            start compared to the previous events early fireworks with Ben taking down the first hands reasonable pot.
            Soon after Michael declared that he was not going to continue his consistent last place finishing position, and lo and behold, he won a hand which for him had been a historically rare event.</p>

        <p>Steve was in most hands, winning a few, losing a few and ended up battling against Carlos. The final river card was dealt and Carlos just showed his full house before the final betting round. Steve's two pair wasn't good enough, but at least he didn't have to put any more chips in the middle to find out.</p>

        <p>Jade was reducing the fridges weight as his beer supplies were diminishing at a rapid rate, but he won a nice pot with 7-2. In most poker circles, 7-2 or seven deuce as it's known is widely regarded as the worst starting hand, but it just shows you, any two cards can win. And the very next hand, guess what Jade receives? Yep, 7-2 again, but lost to Michael who called Jades small bets despite neither player hitting the board.</p>

        <p>I looked down to reveal a pair of Jacks and raised 3 times the big blind, but with Steve taking a rare rest from seeing the flop, Jade and Michael (brimming with newly found confidence from winning some hands) decided to call. By the river, all three players had two pairs but I gratefully received the chips with the highest version of the hand.</p>

        <p>Ben had been quiet for while, but the first to act after the blinds (known as under the gun or UTG), raised 5 big blinds to $1000. If he wanted everyone want to fold, he got his wish, as nobody wanted to play - maybe a bit strong, although with the alcohol flowing, who knows what people might do!</p>

        <p>Into the second session, I picked up a decent pot with an Ace nut flush after Jade called my bets chasing down a straight. In fact, you couldn't keep Jade away from betting as his stack took another pounding sending chips flying towards Carlos, after Carlos had a straight after the turn card. Jade remonstrated to Carlos that he didn't bet on the turn. I'm sure it fell on deaf ears though as the Carlos' poker disguise gave his stack a welcome boost. And to add to Jade's tri-fecta of losses, his Ace matched an ace on the flop with Ben matching a Queen. With only small bets comparable to the pot size gave Ben more incentive
            to stay in the hand and ended up with 2 pairs as he matched his 10 on the river...Everyone waited...and like a trustworthy postman, the famous line got delivered: "It's just not roiigghht"...that's better - all things were right in the world, all boxes ticked, normaility resumed.</p>

        <p>The commentary notes have Jade mentioned more times than a Brazilian favela street kid juggling a football (and that's a lot), but shows how central he was to the nights game. In fact, his chip stack had taken a recent beating, but it was all smiles again, as he took the biggest pot of the night with $30,000 heading his way with a pair of aces after Junior holding KQ, hoping for a ten to make his straight when the flop showed A-J-9. And yet another $15,000 as he took out Michael's trip sixes with a 7 high flush.</p>

        <p>Michael was getting excited about his cards and bet out whilst the flop was about to be dealt, and with blinds increasing all the time, Jade was sitting pretty with a stack the size of Eureka tower, but declined to play one hand when the minimum bet was $1200 stating that "...it's not cheap is it".</p>

        <p>Our first casualty saw host Junior being taken to the cleaners by an all action Michael who had two pairs, but Junior being the super bonus target, took the gamble and re-bought into the game. A fair decision considering the potential pay-day.</p>

        <p>At the 3rd break, surprisingly everyone was still in the game, but stacks compared to the blind levels were moving into the danger zone. One of those stacks was Carlos, but he went on a winning streak winning three hands in the row and moved into his happy place. Michael was still seeing lots of flops and was determined to break his 100% last statistic, but did take a massive hit, with a large serve of chips heading towards Steve.</p>

        <p>With massive blinds, the game had to be heading towards a conclusion, but we still had all the players with chips. So, lucky last needed an owner, and gravitated towards Dave, who unfortunately had not had any decent cards all night and had won only one hand, but kindly took on the dealer role to keep the game ticking over. Carlos was also being blinded out to the point he had to chance his luck, but it didn't hold and he took out 7th place. The casualties were coming thick and fast, with myself pushing in the remainder of my chips hoping my Ace would match the board, but the flop instead gave Jade two pairs, meaning I exited in 6th place.</p>

        <p>Some good news for other players though, as the super bonus will roll over to the next event as Juniors luck finally ran out and he was next out in 5th, meaning the cash bubble arrived with the remaining four players being Jade, Michael, Ben and Steve.</p>

        <p>It's been at least a few sentences without mentioning Jade, so to get back on track, another massive hand has the usually unlucky Jade on close calls edging out Michael, when both had two pairs, but Jade's ace kicker took down the pot. Michael was undeterred though and he was betting well, clawing back some chips from Steve. The time had passed midnight and tired players soon were forced to make decisions to stay in the game. Unfortunately with only a few chips left, Steve had very little choice, but was out in fourth, just missing out on the money.</p>

        <p>Ben was looking for an opportunity to dent Jade's towers, but came unstuck and left the game in 3rd place. More consistent top finishing for Ben, and again making the cash to increase his career earnings.</p>
        <p>So the final two headsup players battling it out for the top 2 places, were Michael entering un-chartered territory and Jade who was having trouble focusing on the cards at this point of the night..</p>

        <p>It was certainly going to be an interesting battle. Surely, the level of inebriation would take it's toll on the skill level...hmmm...well, it kind of did, but just in an inversely proportional kind of way, as not long after, Jade took all the remaining chips to be crowned the victor. Congratulations to Michael for putting up a great effort to make the top two.
        But credit where credits due - Jade played well on the night, had the customary bit of luck needed, but cannot be denied the win.
        </p>

        <p>Many many thanks to Junior and his family for allowing the event to take place - hopefully the late finish didn't impact too much on the kids sleep?</p>

        <p>The ladder now shows Ben returning to the top spot, overtaking Mark L who couldn't play. Dave and Mark V share 3rd and 4th spot followed by Simon W in 5th.
            Jade moves up six places to 6th after previously being in last place, with Michael entering the table in a very respectable 7th place after a good nights result.</p>
