        <h3 style="color:black">Lack of Commentary....by Brian</h3>
    </p>
</p>


<p>Yeah... after 7 years of doing most of the commentary, I think it's time to take a rest....unless anyone else wants to run with it.</p>
<p>There were some notes that didn't make a lot of sense, so the general vibe of the night. So there was pizza... lots of pizza and nachos...hooray to Mark L.
<p>There was ridiculous amounts of bottles. Thanks to Mark V with the offer of recycling bin space!</p>
<p>13 players spread accross 2 tables, deep and meaningful conversations, and a full moon I believe. Well, that was a first... and hopefully the last :)</p>
<p>I do recall Mark V getting off to a flyer, my season's tip Maan ending up with the wooden spoon (never listen to me), and I had a bad night (still a long way to go...ever the
    optimist), and Ben came storming back after a bad season last year.</p>
<p>But hat tips to Michael. After a long drought of being away from the top spot, he's taken out 2 of the last 3 games!</p>
<p>Over and out......but got some pictures though :)</p>
