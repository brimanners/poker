        <h3 style="color:black">Commentary....by Brian</h3>
    </p>

<p>With a couple of late scratchings, 7 players made their way to Brian's for the fourth instalment of the 2018 poker calendar. With some pre-game
meat laden pizzas and garlic bread tucked away nicely in their stomachs, they headed towards to the table ready to pit their skills against other players,
and hope to take Brian out at the same time, as a double bounty bonus was on offer.</p>

<p>Andrew L came flying out of the blocks to take down the first hand with a nice pot after his two pair was bigger than Michael's two pair.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Brian managed to take down a pot with two pair when heads-up with Ben, with Ben chasing down a straight, which did not materialise.</p>

<p>Brian also increased his chip stack when he raised pre-flop with KK, with Mark L the only other player to come along for the ride with K-5.
With the remaining King not appearing, which undoubtedly would have made the hand more exciting, it was an Ace that slowed down the betting, but Brian was happy to pull
in the chips.</p>

<p>Ben was getting some serious junk, but Brian was getting all the pre-flop luck, as he woke with QQ. Again, the field was whittled down to only Mark L
whose suited 10-8 was going to need some help. Mark did have a gutshot (4 outs) by the turn, but Brian held on again to take all the chips.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before we had the nights first all-in after the flop, when Mark V secured the services of pocket Aces. Michael called as he had
flopped a flush, leaving Mark with a short stack, and ruing his back luck.</p>

<p>Mark V then shoved his remaining stack with J-6, but Brian had secured trip 8's, so Mark who was not having the best start to the tournament received his partial chip-up 45 minutes from the start of game.</p>

<p>It wasn't all bad news for Mark V though, and the last hand before the first break was massive. Mark V had been in more action than Stormy Daniels in a Dallas Hotel and replenished his chips to levels not seen
prior to the first break. With no raise pre-flop, we had Brian (3-4), Andrew (K-K) and Mark (8-8) see an action 8-4-4 flop. Brian raised (trip 4's), Mark V
re-raised (flopped full house), and Andrew called (Strong two pair). Brian, hoping that Mark only had one 8 or an overpair, shoved all in, and it was not a difficult decision for Mark who called, with Andrew also staying in the hand.
    It's fair to say, that the slightly looser than normal betting
was due to the fact that more chips were forthcoming, but with no help for Brian and Andrew, Mark V piled the massive chip collection towards his side
of the table. Who said he was not having the best start to the tournament?</p>

<p>Into the second hour, you could just not keep Mark V from being involved. Holding A-Q, with his namesake Mark L holding 8-2, we saw an 8-A-Q flop.
With the turn then revealing a 2, both players had two pair, and Mark L shoved all-in, which didn't take long for Mark V to call. The drama was not over though
when the river magically provided another 8 to give Mark L a full house and save him from venturing into his wallet for a re-buy.</p>

<p>It might have been easier to have a Mark V stamp for the notes, as his name appears so much, and on this occasion, he took Andrew L's last chips and
with the nights enjoyment not wanting to end quite yet, Andrew reached for his wallet for to re-buy into the the tournament</p>



<p>To say some people are addicted to their football code would be an understatement for many, and Michael was a case in point. With his Ipad
sat up next to him to watch his beloved All Blacks take on Australia, meant that come deal time, he needed a bit of prodding in-between sports
noises and obscenities been shouted as the referee on his small screen. In fact with Andy F turning up and watching the game in the lounge,
we witnessed various echos type roars, due to the time lag on the ipad compared to the tv screening. Michael was being distracted with the conversation going along the lines of</p>

<p>Brian: "Come on dealer"</p>
<p>Michael: "I was the dealer last time"</p>
<p>Brian: "I know, can you deal the flop please?"</p>

<p>With blinds at 500/1000 and the egg chasing game completed with the All Blacks victorious, Michael resumed his concentration and went into battle with Ben.
Ben raised pre-flop with pocket 10's, and Michael called with pocket 6's as we saw a J,10,J flop. Ben was licking his lips with anticipation with his flopped
full house. Ben bet, but not enough for Michael to fold. The turn showed another Jack, and Michael pushed all in. Ben deliberated, and then
deliberated some more. Andrew amusingly called time on him, and eventually Ben folded the best hand asking Michael if he had the Quad Jacks.
Michael gave a little smile and smashed down his 6's</p>

<p>Before the third hour, the oven went into overdrive providing even more food, with the traditional Nacho's gratefully being provided by Mark L,
but Michael had also complemented the nights gastic offerings with sausage rolls. Coupled with bags of chips and other snacks, no-one was
going home hungry. In fact, we witnessed the first time that the nachos' weren't devoured in about 5 minutes!</p>

<p>Ben was still running though his fold from his earlier face off with Michael, but took some of Andrew's chips when Andrews pocket 2's were
no match for Ben's pair of Aces.</p>

<p>Ben though, when holding A-4 was unfortunate not to take down a good pot, after being counterfeited on the river after getting heads up with
Brian holding A-3. The board of 6-6-5-4 meant Ben was ahead with 2 pair, and Brian with 1 pair. The river card being a 5, meant that now
both players had two pair 6's and 5's with an Ace kicker. If only 3 pair was a valid hand!</p>

<p>Dave was playing his usual straight bat poker, but did make an excellent fold after his Q-Q was taking on Andrew L's A-A! With no help
on the board, and a good raise by Andrew meant Dave folded a premium hand, and probably saved himself some chips!</p>

<p>The pocket rockets then made their way to Michael, and with Brian holding Q-10 on a Q-3-5 board, Brian shoved all in. He received the bad
news, but decided to delve into his seasons winnings to re-buy.</p>

<p>The re-buys hadn't finished there though, with Ben delving into his wallet after Andrew's A-K made a flush by the turn with Ben's A-Q not
getting any help.</p>

<p>Mark L then disappeared into the blackness of the night, after his al-fresco style of territory marking at the neighbours houses meant
he had now christened another poker venue. He even kindly graced the table with his flatulent ablutions several times during the course of the night, complemented
with information about the chemical composition statistics, somewhat reminiscent of the "infamous shack" game held several seasons ago.</p>

<p>With the new big blind ante structure adopted, serious pressure was being put on players short stacks, and Ben took down the wooden spoon position
on the night after Michael's full house smashed him out of the park.</p>

<p>And it wasn't long after, that the new grim reaper Michael swung his trusty scythe to end the night for Mark L. Mark "I thought was good there" when his
two pair was no match for Michaels trip 9's.</p>

<p>With Ben taking on the dealer responsibility, but then dealing himself some cards (maybe as he's not used to going out so early!), he did eventually deal out the
pocket Aces to Mark V, who survived against Michael's big stack when he held A-Q.</p>

<p>With Mark L's OCD kicking in with the fridge door status, and Ben's minor dealing infractions, he took on the dealing himself, and then promptly dealt out
the flop without giving anyone any cards... We're all human eh...</p>

<p>With 5 players left, it soon became time to say goodbye to Dave, who slips from his usual 4th spot back to 5th. It seems his exit must not have been exactly
note-worthy, as there are no notes. Apologies if this was in fact a momentus exit, and the author was too shocked/drunk to make details about it.</p>

<p>With the top three players getting paid for their nights exploits, the cash bubble was upon Andrew, Mark V, Brian and Michael. With blinds
and ante's decimating the chips more than a dieter having one day off, Mark V chanced his luck with his 8-4, on a 8-7-2 flop. Andy decided to call
with his K-Q overcards, and hit a queen on the turn. Mark V had had a action packed night, with more up and downs than the undergarments of one
of the workers at the local establishments that was mentioned on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Brian's stack had been heading in the wrong direction for quite a few hands, and with only 2 big blinds worth of chips, he shoved with 10-2 clubs.
He was marginally ahead of Andrew's call with 4-6o, but by the river, Andrew had a straight. Sayanara Brian, leaving Andrew to take down the double
    bounty prize and Brian to take more notes. Oh... they seem to have dried up. Just staring at whitespace on the paper...so the rest is probably as
    likely to have happened as Donald Trump always telling the truth.</p>

<p>A ding dong battle of two fine poker machines battling out to get their first ever win in the renowned August Square poker tour.
    With the chip mountains flying back and forth between table ends, there were visible
beads of sweat on the brows due to the stress of the psychological warfare taking place with so much on the line.... Hmm - Andy won. Thankfully, with
photo evidence to prove it, it seems Andrew took out the night with trip aces, when his A-3 against Michael's Q-4 both matched the A-J-Q flop.
    With the turn another Ace and a 7 river, meant Andrew had done it.. The crowds erupted.. hmm - I think Ben was still there....</p>

<p>Congratulations Andrew on his first win, and unlucky Michael who so got so close to his own first placing. There's always next time!</p>

<p>See you at the shack!</p>
